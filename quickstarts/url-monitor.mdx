This guide walks you through creating your first URL monitor to check the availability and performance of your websites, APIs, or any HTTP-based service.

Each URL monitor is defined by its request configuration, which includes the target URL and how its availability and performance should be validated.

## Basic Setup

Configure your URL monitor by specifying the endpoint and request method:

</Frame>

* **Request method:** Always `GET`
* **URL:** The HTTP(S) URL to monitor (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)
* **IP family:** Defaults to IPv4

## Response Validation

### Assertions
Validate the returned response status code:

### Response Performance
Define performance thresholds for degraded or failed states:

## Frequency

Set how often the monitor runs (every 10 seconds to 24 hours).

## Scheduling & Locations

* **Scheduling:** Choose between round-robin or parallel execution. Learn more about [scheduling strategies](/concepts/scheduling)
* **Locations:** Select one or more [public](/concepts/locations) or [private](/platform/private-locations/overview) locations to run the monitor from

## Additional Settings

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/communicate/maintenance-windows/overview)
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/communicate/alerts/retries)
* **Alerting:** Configure your [alert settings](/communicate/alerts/configuration), [alert channels](/communicate/alerts/channels), or set up [webhooks](/communicate/alerts/webhooks) for custom integrations
