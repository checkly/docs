<Tip>
Learn more about Status Pages in [the Status Pages overview](/communicate/status-pages/overview).
</Tip>

Use incident triggers to automatically create and resolve an incident and notify subscribers based on the alert configuration of a monitor or check. This allows you to link synthetic monitoring failures directly to incidents on your status pages.

<CodeGroup>
```ts Basic Example highlight={12-19,29}
import {
  Frequency,
  IncidentTrigger,
  PlaywrightCheck,
  StatusPageService,
} from "checkly/constructs";

const searchService = new StatusPageService("search-service", {
  name: "Search Service",
});

const searchIncidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  severity: "MINOR",
  name: "Search is down",
  description:
    "Some users experience issues with the product search. We're investigating.",
  notifySubscribers: true,
};

new PlaywrightCheck("playwright-check-suite", {
  name: "Search Monitoring",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  activated: true,
  pwProjects: ["Search Monitoring"],
  locations: ["us-east-1", "eu-west-1", "ap-southeast-2"],
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  triggerIncident: searchIncidentTrigger,
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## `IncidentTrigger` Options

<ResponseField name="service" type="StatusPageService" required>
The status page service that this incident will be associated with. When a check or monitor fails, an incident is created for this service and connected status pages.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={6}
const searchService = new StatusPageService("search-service", {
  name: "Search Service",
})

const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  /* More options... */
}
```

**Use cases**: Linking monitors to specific services, automatic incident creation, service-based status tracking.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="severity" type="IncidentSeverity" required>
The severity level of the incident. Determines how the incident is displayed and prioritized.

**Options:**
- `MINOR` - Minor impact, most users unaffected
- `MEDIUM` - Moderate impact, some users affected
- `MAJOR` - Major impact, many users affected
- `CRITICAL` - Critical impact, all users affected

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  severity: "MAJOR",
  /* More options... */
}
```

**Use cases**: Incident prioritization, user communication, escalation workflows.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
The name of the incident displayed on the status page. Should clearly communicate the issue to users.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  name: "Search is down",
  /* More options... */
}
```

**Use cases**: User communication, incident identification, status page clarity.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="description" type="string" required>
A detailed description of the incident. Provides context to users about what's happening and potential impact.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3-4}
const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  description:
    "Some users experience issues with the product search. We're investigating.",
  /* More options... */
}
```

**Use cases**: User communication, incident context, expectation setting.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="notifySubscribers" type="boolean" required>
Whether to notify status page subscribers when the incident is triggered. When `true`, subscribers receive notifications via their configured channels.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
const incidentTrigger: IncidentTrigger = {
  service: searchService,
  notifySubscribers: true,
  /* More options... */
}
```

**Use cases**: Proactive user communication, incident awareness, stakeholder updates.
