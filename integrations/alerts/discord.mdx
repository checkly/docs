Checkly integrates with [Discord](https://discord.com/) and can
deliver failure, degradation, and recovery messages to any project in your Discord server / channel.

1. First, create a **Webhook**. Log in to Discord and go to "Server Settings" > "Integrations" and click "Create Webhook".

2. **Choose a name** for your integration like "Checkly" and [add this Checkly icon](https://cdn.checklyhq.com/logos/fat_racoon_square.png).
    Click the "Copy the Webhook URL" to...well...copy the Webhook URL

4. Give the alert channel a name and **paste the Webhook URL** in their respective input fields. You can now also tweak
   which alerts you want to be notified of and which checks or check groups should be subscribed to this channel.

   <Callout type="note">
   Note that we provide a preconfigured message payload but you are free to edit the payload and add more or different
   variables. Just click the "Edit payload" button and reference the "Help & variables tab".
   </Callout>

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated Checkly with Discord!

## Advanced Discord Configuration

### Custom Discord Alerts

For more control over Discord alert formatting, you can create custom webhook payloads using Discord's embed format:

```json
{
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
      "description": "**Check**: {{CHECK_NAME}}\n**Location**: {{RUN_LOCATION}}\n**Response Time**: {{RESPONSE_TIME}}ms",
      "color": "{{#eq ALERT_TYPE 'ALERT_FAILURE'}}15158332{{else}}{{#eq ALERT_TYPE 'ALERT_DEGRADED'}}16776960{{else}}3066993{{/eq}}{{/eq}}",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "Error",
          "value": "{{CHECK_ERROR_MESSAGE}}",
          "inline": false
        },
        {
          "name": "Started At",
          "value": "{{STARTED_AT}}",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "Location",
          "value": "{{RUN_LOCATION}}",
          "inline": true
        }
      ],
      "footer": {
        "text": "Checkly Monitoring"
      },
      "timestamp": "{{STARTED_AT}}",
      "url": "{{RESULT_LINK}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Discord Alert Colors

Use different colors to distinguish alert types:

- **Red (15158332)**: Failures and critical alerts
- **Orange (16776960)**: Degraded performance alerts  
- **Green (3066993)**: Recovery notifications

### Discord Best Practices

- Use separate channels for different environments (production, staging, development)
- Configure appropriate notification settings to avoid alert fatigue
- Use Discord's thread feature for grouping related alerts
- Set up role mentions (@role) for critical alerts that require immediate attention
