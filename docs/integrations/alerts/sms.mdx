SMS and phone call notifications provide immediate alert delivery for your most critical monitoring scenarios. These channels are ideal for high-priority alerts that require immediate attention.

## SMS Alert Configuration

Set up text message notifications for critical alerts:

```yaml
SMS Configuration:
  Phone Numbers:
    - "+1-555-0123" # On-call engineer
    - "+1-555-0456" # Backup engineer
  
Message Format: "[CHECKLY] {{CHECK_NAME}} failed at {{RUN_LOCATION}}. {{RESULT_LINK}}"

Alert Conditions:
  Triggers: ALERT_FAILURE only
  Checks: Critical production services
  Time Restrictions: 24/7 or business hours only
```

## Phone Call Escalation

Configure voice call alerts for highest priority incidents:

```yaml
Phone Call Configuration:
  Numbers: Primary and backup on-call
  Trigger Conditions:
    - Critical checks (tagged as "P1")
    - Multiple location failures
    - Extended outage duration (>10 minutes)
  
Message Script:
  "This is a Checkly alert. The {{CHECK_NAME}} check has failed from {{RUN_LOCATION}}. 
   Please check your monitoring dashboard immediately."
  
Escalation Rules:
  - Call primary on-call first
  - If no answer within 5 minutes, call backup
  - Repeat cycle until acknowledged
```

## SMS and Phone Best Practices

### When to Use SMS and Phone Alerts

**SMS Alerts are ideal for:**
- Critical production service failures
- Security incidents requiring immediate attention
- Alerts that need to reach on-call staff outside business hours
- Backup notification when other channels fail

**Phone Calls should be reserved for:**
- Highest priority incidents only (P1/Critical)
- Multiple simultaneous failures indicating widespread issues
- Extended outages lasting more than 10-15 minutes
- Emergency situations requiring immediate response

### Message Content Optimization

**SMS Message Guidelines:**
- Keep messages concise (160 characters or less)
- Include essential information: service name, location, error type
- Always include a direct link to detailed results
- Use abbreviations when necessary: "API" instead of "Application Programming Interface"

**Phone Call Scripts:**
- Keep voice messages brief and clear
- Speak slowly and repeat critical information
- Include specific instructions for next steps
- Mention the monitoring system name for context

### Managing Alert Fatigue

**Frequency Controls:**
- Set minimum time intervals between SMS alerts for the same check
- Use escalation policies to avoid overwhelming on-call staff
- Configure different phone numbers for different severity levels

**Smart Routing:**
- Route different types of alerts to appropriate personnel
- Use time-based routing for business hours vs after-hours coverage
- Implement round-robin calling for distributed on-call teams

### Integration with On-Call Systems

**PagerDuty Integration:**
- Use PagerDuty's SMS and phone capabilities for more sophisticated on-call management
- Leverage escalation policies and acknowledgment features
- Track response times and on-call effectiveness

**Custom On-Call Solutions:**
- Build webhook integrations that trigger your internal on-call systems
- Use SMS APIs like Twilio for programmatic message sending
- Implement custom escalation logic based on your team's needs

### Cost Considerations

**SMS and Phone Alert Costs:**
- SMS messages typically cost per message sent
- Phone calls are usually charged by minute
- International SMS and calls are significantly more expensive
- Consider cost implications when designing alert frequency

**Cost Optimization:**
- Use SMS/phone alerts only for truly critical scenarios
- Implement proper escalation policies to minimize redundant alerts
- Monitor usage and costs regularly
- Consider time zones when setting up international on-call rotations
