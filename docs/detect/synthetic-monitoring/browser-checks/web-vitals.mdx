Next to this, we also automatically collect Performance signals (**Web Vitals**) for each of the pages you visit in the browser session.

![tracing and web vitals for Playwright based browser checks](/images/docs/images/browser-checks/tracing_web_vitals.png)

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Checkly only collects tracing and web vitals data if your browser check meets the following criteria:
- It is based on **Playwright**.
- It runs on any **runtime above [2021.06](/cli/runtimes)**
</Callout>

## Page navigations

For each page you visit, we automatically collect the following:

1. Any `error`, `warning` or `info` level console messages.
2. Any network requests, like `xhr/fetch`, `javascript`, `css` and others.

You can use this data to quickly find issues with the pages you visit. Use cases are:

- Finding critical errors in your JavaScript by scanning the console logs.
- Pinpoint missing images or other resources: they will show a `404` in the network tab.

## Performance tracing with Web Vitals

For each page your script visits, we automatically collect a set of five [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/learn-web-vitals/).
Web Vitals are user focused quality signals for web pages that indicate a good, ok or poor user experience.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="First Contentful Paint (FCP)" icon="paintbrush">
**Initial Content Display**
Measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any content is rendered. A large FCP means users see a white screen for too long, doubting whether the page works at all.

</Card>

<Card title="Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)" icon="image">
**Main Content Loading**
Measures the time to render the largest visual item within the browser viewport. High LCP means users wait too long before the most useful part of your page loads.

</Card>

<Card title="Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)" icon="arrows-to-circle">
**Visual Stability**
An aggregate metric that signals screen elements "jumping around" as the page loads. Low CLS means you have a stable page layout.

</Card>

<Card title="Total Blocking Time (TBT)" icon="clock">
**Main Thread Responsiveness**
Reflects the time a web page is "blocked" from receiving user input because the main rendering thread is busy. High TBT means sluggish user interactions.

</Card>

<Card title="Time to First Byte (TTFB)" icon="server">
**Server Response Time**
Indicates how long it took for your server to respond with the first byte of content. TTFB can vary based on location and network conditions.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Web Vitals are a part [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), but the two are not the same: Web Vitals are a lighter, higher-level tool built on existing browser APIs. Being less resource-intensive than Lighthouse, Web Vitals can be reliably calculated for you on cloud resources every minute.
</Callout>

## Why are some Web Vitals not reported?

Checkly automatically instruments your Playwright code to collect Web Vitals metrics. However, in some cases we will not
be able to collect a good measurement. There are multiple reasons for this:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
<Card title="Single Page Applications (SPAs)" icon="code">
**Route-Based Navigation**
A Single Page App like a React, Vue or Angular app only has one HTML page load event and then relies on route changes.
The underlying [library we use for collecting Web Vitals](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web-vitals) does not yet account for this.
The folks over at Google are aware of this and [posted an FAQ](https://web.dev/vitals-spa-faq/).
</Card>

<Card title="Fast Script Execution" icon="bolt">
**Insufficient Measurement Time**
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) relies on layout events accumulating over time. If your script exits very fast, or triggers
a redirect, there might not be enough time to actually "catch" this metric.
</Card>

<Card title="Interaction Requirements" icon="hand-pointer">
**User Interaction Needed**
Some metrics require a small amount of interaction to effectively "trigger". Clicking a button or other screen element
in your Playwright script can help here.

<Callout type="tip" emoji="🔄">
We are constantly tweaking and updating our Web Vitals collection code, so expect improvements in the future!

## Lab metrics vs. Field metrics

Checkly collects "lab" metrics for you. These are different from "field" metrics. 

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Lab Metrics" icon="flask">
**Controlled Environment**
- Collected in synthetic environments
- Generated by your Browser check scripts
- Useful for establishing baselines
- Helps identify performance regressions
- Perfect for pre-deployment testing
</Card>

<Card title="Field Metrics" icon="users">
**Real User Monitoring (RUM)**
- Based on real user traffic
- Collected "in the wild"
- Varies by device, location, network
- Provides actual user experience data
- Essential for production monitoring
</Card>
