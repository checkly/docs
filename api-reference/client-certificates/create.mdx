## Overview

The Create Client Certificate endpoint allows you to upload new client certificates for use with mutual TLS authentication in your monitoring checks. Certificates enable secure authentication with services requiring certificate-based client verification.

**Common Use Cases**:
- mTLS Setup
- Secure Service Monitoring
- Certificate Deployment
- Authentication Configuration

<Warning>
Store certificate private keys securely and never expose them in logs or public repositories. Certificates provide authentication credentials for your monitoring checks.
</Warning>

<Note>
Client certificates must be valid and properly formatted. Ensure certificates are not expired and include necessary intermediate certificates for proper chain validation.
