1. Create an API key in the **Settings** > **Auth Tokens** section.

2. Grab the right endpoint URL for your Dash0 organization from the **Settings** > **Endpoints** section. It should look like `https://ingress.eu-west-1.aws.dash0.com/v1/traces`.
   Make sure it ends with `/v1/traces/`
3. Add the endpoint and the auth token to the Checkly integration settings. The auth token is added as an HTTP header named
   `Authorization` with the value of `Bearer ` and your auth token.
