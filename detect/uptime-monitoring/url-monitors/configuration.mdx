### Basic Setup

Monitor any URL by specifying the endpoint you want to track. You can configure the HTTP method, add request headers, and set SSL/redirect options:

</Frame>

### Assertions

Use assertions to validate the status code of your URL request. When one or more assertions fail, an alert is triggered:

</Frame>

**Status Code:** Verify your endpoint returns the expected HTTP status code using the comparison dropdown. Choose from equals, not equals, greater than, or less than.

### Response Time Limits

Set performance thresholds to ensure your application meets speed requirements:

  <img src="/images/url-monitor-response-times.png" alt="URL monitor response time limits interface showing degraded and failed thresholds" />
</Frame>

**Degraded After**: Time threshold (in milliseconds) after which the check is marked as degraded but not failed. Use for performance warnings without triggering failure alerts.

**Failed After**: Time threshold after which the check fails completely. Use for hard performance limits where slow responses should trigger alerts.

### Frequency

Determine how often your monitors run. Unlike Synthetic Monitors, URL Monitors do not consume "Checks" and can run at any frequency available to your plan:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-frequency.png" alt="URL monitor frequency selection interface showing available check intervals" />
</Frame>

Choose a frequency that balances monitoring coverage with resource usage. Higher frequencies provide faster detection but may not be necessary for all services.

### Scheduling Strategy

Choose when and how your checks run across multiple locations:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-scheduling.png" alt="URL monitor scheduling strategy interface showing round robin vs fixed schedule options" />
</Frame>

**Round Robin** (Default): Checks run from one random location each interval. Most cost-effective option for general availability monitoring.

**Fixed Schedule**: Checks run from all selected locations simultaneously. Higher consumption but provides immediate global visibility for critical services.

### Locations

Select from Checkly's global monitoring locations to test your URLs from different regions:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-locations.png" alt="URL monitor locations selection interface showing global monitoring locations" />
</Frame>

Choose 2-3 locations that best represent your user base for optimal monitoring coverage. 

See [Locations](/concepts/locations) for the complete list of available regions and guidance on location selection.

<Info>
**Private Locations**: Run checks from your own infrastructure to monitor internal applications, check services behind firewalls, or maintain data residency compliance. [Set up Private Locations ‚Üí](/detect/private-locations/overview)
</Info>

### Retries

Select the retry strategy to determine how failed checks are retried:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-retries.png" alt="URL monitor retries interface showing retry strategy options" />
</Frame>

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **None** | No retries - fail immediately on first failure for fastest detection |
| **Single** | Retry once after failure with configurable delay |
| **Fixed** | Retry a specific number of times with consistent intervals between attempts |
| **Linear** | Increase retry delay linearly with each attempt to avoid overwhelming failed services |
| **Exponential** | Double the retry delay with each attempt for maximum protection against service overload |

### Alert Settings

Configure notifications for your team:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-alert.png" alt="URL monitor alert settings interface showing notification configuration options" />
</Frame>

#### Notification Scope

Choose how alerts are configured for this monitor:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use global account notification settings** | Inherit notification preferences from Global Notification Settings |
| **Use specific notification settings** | Configure alert behavior exclusively for this check |

#### Escalation Rules

Control when alerts are triggered:

**Primary Trigger** (Choose one):
- **When a check has failed X time(s)**: Sends alert after specified consecutive failures
- **When a check is failing for more than Y minutes**: Sends alert if failure duration exceeds threshold

**Additional Condition** (Optional):
- **When a check is failing in Z% of locations**: Only applies to checks running in parallel across multiple locations

#### Reminders

Configure follow-up alerts after initial failure notification:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Maximum reminders** | Number of follow-up alerts (0 = no reminders) |
| **Reminder interval** | Time between reminders (only if maximum reminders > 0) |

#### Alert Channels

Define where notifications are sent when checks fail or recover. Additional channels can be configured in global notification settings.

**Alert Types** (per channel):
- ‚úÖ **Success/Recovery**: Check has recovered from failure
- ‚ö† **Warning**: Check is degraded but not failed  
- ‚ùå **Failure**: Check has failed
- üîí **Locked/Restricted**: Channel access limited

<Note>
**Global Alert Settings**: By default, monitors inherit your account's notification preferences. Select "Use specific notification settings" to customize alerts for individual monitors.
