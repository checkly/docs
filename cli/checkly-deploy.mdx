The `checkly deploy` command deploys all your checks and associated resources like alert channels to your Checkly account. This command synchronizes your local monitoring-as-code configuration with your Checkly account.

<CliCommandPrerequisites command="checkly deploy" />

## Usage

The basic command deploys all resources to your Checkly account, synchronizing your local monitoring-as-code configuration with the Checkly monitoring infrastructure.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--config, -c` | The Checkly CLI configuration file. If not passed, uses the `checkly.config.ts\|js` file in the current directory. |
| `--force, -f` | Force mode. Skips the confirmation dialog. |
| `--output, -o` | Show the changes made after the deploy command. |
| `--preview, -p` | Show a preview of the changes made by the deploy command. |
| `--[no-]schedule-on-deploy` | Enables automatic check scheduling after a deploy. |
| `--[no-]verify-runtime-dependencies` | Return an error if checks import dependencies that are not supported by the selected runtime. |

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--[no-]schedule-on-deploy" type="boolean" default="true">

Prevent checks from running automatically when they are deployed.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --schedule-on-deploy
npx checkly deploy --no-schedule-on-deploy
```

Useful when you want to deploy changes but delay monitoring execution until later.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--[no-]verify-runtime-dependencies" type="boolean" default="true">

Return an error if checks import dependencies that are not supported by the selected runtime.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --verify-runtime-dependencies
npx checkly deploy --no-verify-runtime-dependencies
```

Runtime-dependent checks run in a specific runtime with a pre-defined set of dependencies. If you're using private locations and want to provide your own dependencies, disable the built-in dependency validation.

<Tip>You can provide custom dependencies in [Playwright Check Suites](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) because they don't rely on a specific runtime.</Tip>

## Git Integration

When you deploy a project, you can attach Git-specific information so changes to any resources are displayed in the Checkly web UI with the correct commit, branch, and author information.

The Checkly CLI evaluates Git information from your local or CI environment on a best effort basis. Override any automatically detected values by setting the corresponding environment variables.
