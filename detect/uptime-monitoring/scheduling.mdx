Proper scheduling ensures effective monitoring while balancing detection speed, resource usage, and costs. This guide covers scheduling strategies for all monitor types.

## Monitoring Frequency Options

Different monitor types support various frequency settings:

### Standard Frequencies
- **Every 10 seconds** - Ultra-high frequency for critical services
- **Every 30 seconds** - High frequency monitoring
- **Every minute** - Standard high-frequency monitoring
- **Every 5 minutes** - Balanced monitoring (most common)
- **Every 10 minutes** - Moderate frequency
- **Every 15 minutes** - Lower frequency monitoring
- **Every 30 minutes** - Infrequent monitoring
- **Every hour** - Low frequency monitoring
- **Custom intervals** - Up to 24 hours for specific needs

## Frequency Selection Guidelines

### By Service Criticality

**Critical Production Services:**
```yaml
Frequency: Every 10 Seconds - 2 Minutes
Examples: Payment processing, user authentication, core APIs
Rationale: Immediate detection of issues affecting users
```

**Important Services:**
```yaml
Frequency: Every 5-10 minutes  
Examples: Secondary APIs, admin interfaces, reporting tools
Rationale: Quick detection with reasonable resource usage
```

**Non-Critical Services:**
```yaml
Frequency: Every 15-30 minutes
Examples: Documentation sites, internal tools, dev environments
Rationale: Monitor availability without excessive overhead
```

### By Business Hours

**Business-Critical Services:**
```yaml
Business Hours (9 AM - 6 PM): Every 1 minute
After Hours: Every 5 minutes
Weekends: Every 10 minutes
```

**Internal Services:**
```yaml
Business Hours: Every 5 minutes
After Hours: Every 15 minutes  
Weekends: Every 30 minutes
```

## Scheduling Strategies

### Parallel vs. Round-Robin Execution

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Parallel Execution" icon="fast-forward">
All locations run simultaneously for fastest detection
</Card>

<Card title="Round-Robin" icon="rotate">
Locations run sequentially to reduce server load
</Card>
</CardGroup>

**Parallel Execution:**
- **Use for**: Critical services requiring immediate alerts
- **Benefits**: Fastest issue detection, simultaneous global status
- **Considerations**: Higher server load, increased monitoring costs

**Round-Robin Execution:**
- **Use for**: Cost-sensitive or non-critical monitoring
- **Benefits**: Distributed server load, lower monitoring costs
- **Considerations**: Slower issue detection, sequential location testing

### Dynamic Scheduling

Adjust frequency based on current conditions:

**Deployment Monitoring:**
```yaml
During Deployment: Every 30 seconds
Post-Deployment (1 hour): Every 2 minutes
Normal Operations: Every 5 minutes
```

**Incident Response:**
```yaml
During Incident: Every 30 seconds
Recovery Period (2 hours): Every 1 minute
Stable State: Return to normal frequency
```

## Service-Specific Scheduling

### Web Applications and APIs

**E-commerce Sites:**
```yaml
Homepage: Every 1 minute (critical for revenue)
Product Pages: Every 5 minutes
Search API: Every 2 minutes
Checkout Flow: Every 30 seconds
```

**SaaS Applications:**
```yaml
Login Endpoint: Every 1 minute
Core Features: Every 5 minutes
Admin Interfaces: Every 15 minutes
Status Pages: Every 10 minutes
```

### Infrastructure Monitoring

**Database Servers:**
```yaml
Primary Database: Every 2 minutes
Read Replicas: Every 5 minutes
Backup Systems: Every 15 minutes
```

**Load Balancers and Proxies:**
```yaml
Production Load Balancer: Every 1 minute
Staging Environment: Every 10 minutes
Development Proxies: Every 30 minutes
```

### Scheduled Jobs and Heartbeats

**Daily Jobs:**
```yaml
Period: 24 hours
Grace Period: 30-60 minutes
Example: Nightly backups, daily reports
```

**Hourly Jobs:**
```yaml
Period: 1 hour  
Grace Period: 10-15 minutes
Example: Data sync, cache refresh
```

**High-Frequency Jobs:**
```yaml
Period: 5-15 minutes
Grace Period: 2-5 minutes  
Example: Real-time data processing, monitoring tasks
```

## Cost and Performance Optimization

### Balancing Coverage and Cost

**High-Value Optimization:**
```yaml
Strategy: Monitor critical paths frequently, everything else moderately
Implementation:
  - User-facing services: Every 1-2 minutes
  - Internal APIs: Every 5-10 minutes
  - Dev/staging: Every 15-30 minutes
```

**Cost-Conscious Approach:**
```yaml
Strategy: Focus on essential monitoring with smart frequency
Implementation:
  - Core services only: Every 5 minutes
  - Reduce locations for non-critical services
  - Use longer intervals during off-peak hours
```

### Resource Impact Considerations

**Server Load Management:**
- Higher frequency = more requests to your servers
- Use round-robin scheduling to distribute load
- Consider rate limiting and caching implications
- Monitor your server metrics during frequency changes

**Monitoring Budget:**
- More frequent checks = higher monitoring costs
- Balance detection speed with budget constraints
- Review and adjust frequencies based on actual value

## Advanced Scheduling Patterns

### Time-Based Scheduling

**Business Hours Focus:**
```yaml
Business Hours (9 AM - 6 PM, Mon-Fri):
  - Frequency: Every 1 minute
  - All locations enabled
  
Off Hours:
  - Frequency: Every 10 minutes
  - Reduced location set
```

**Seasonal Adjustments:**
```yaml
High Traffic Periods (Black Friday, holidays):
  - Increase frequency by 50%
  - Add additional monitoring locations
  - Enable all alert channels

Normal Periods:
  - Standard frequency settings
  - Regular location coverage
```

### Geographic Scheduling

**Follow-the-Sun Monitoring:**
```yaml
Active Business Region:
  - Higher frequency during local business hours
  - All alerting channels active

Other Regions:
  - Reduced frequency during local off-hours
  - Essential alerting only
```

### Failure-Adaptive Scheduling

**Automatic Frequency Adjustment:**
```yaml
Healthy State: Normal frequency (every 5 minutes)
Warning State: Increased frequency (every 2 minutes)  
Critical State: Maximum frequency (every 30 seconds)
Recovery: Gradual return to normal frequency
```

## Troubleshooting Scheduling Issues

### Common Problems

**Over-Monitoring:**
- **Symptoms**: High monitoring costs, server load issues
- **Solutions**: Reduce frequency for non-critical services, use round-robin scheduling

**Under-Monitoring:**
- **Symptoms**: Late issue detection, missed outages
- **Solutions**: Increase frequency for critical paths, add more locations

**Inconsistent Detection:**
- **Symptoms**: Intermittent alerts, unclear failure patterns
- **Solutions**: Adjust grace periods, review timeout settings

### Performance Impact Analysis

**Monitor Your Monitors:**
```yaml
Track Metrics:
  - Server response time during monitoring
  - Resource utilization patterns
  - Alert frequency and false positives
  - Mean time to detection vs. frequency
```

**Optimization Signals:**
```yaml
Increase Frequency When:
  - High business impact of downtime
  - Frequent but brief outages
  - Service instability periods

Decrease Frequency When:
  - Stable service with rare issues
  - High monitoring costs
  - Server load concerns
```

## Best Practices

### Initial Configuration
1. **Start conservative** with 5-10 minute intervals
2. **Monitor high-impact services more frequently**
3. **Adjust based on actual failure patterns**
4. **Consider business hours and user activity**

### Ongoing Optimization
- **Review frequency effectiveness** quarterly
- **Adjust during high-risk periods** (deployments, traffic spikes)
- **Balance detection speed with cost constraints**
- **Use data-driven decisions** based on incident history

### Documentation and Communication
- **Document scheduling rationale** for different services
- **Communicate frequency changes** to relevant teams
- **Track scheduling effectiveness** over time
- **Regular review with stakeholders**
