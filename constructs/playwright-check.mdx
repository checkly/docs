</Tip>

<PlaywrightCheckSuiteBetaNote />

Use Playwright Check Suites to reuse your existing Playwright test suite to run it as end-to-end tests and synthetic monitoring. The examples below show how to configure Playwright Check Suites for different testing and monitoring scenarios.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before creating Playwright Check Suites, ensure you have:

- An initialized Checkly CLI project
- A running Playwright test suite
- A public website you want to monitor
- Understanding of [Playwright test syntax and structure](/learn/playwright/overview)

For additional setup information, see [CLI overview](/cli/overview).
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>

```ts Basic Example
import { PlaywrightCheck } from "checkly/constructs"

new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
})
```

```ts Advanced Example
import { PlaywrightCheck } from "checkly/constructs"

new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
  installCommand: "npm ci",
  testCommand: "npx playwright test --retries=2",
  pwProjects: ["chromium"],
  pwTags: ["e2e"],
  include: [".npmrc"],
})
```

</CodeGroup>

### Playwright Check Suite Options

<ResponseField name="playwrightConfigPath" type="string" required>

The path to the Playwright configuration file (`playwright.config.js/ts`) which defines test settings, browser configurations, and project structure.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
})
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="installCommand" type="string">

The command to install dependencies before running tests. This configuration is useful for ensuring test dependencies are available in the runtime environment.

Checkly defaults to using npm, but automatically detects other package managers if lock files are present.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  installCommand: "npm ci",
})
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="testCommand" type="string" default="npx playwright test">

The command to execute Playwright tests when running `npx checkly test` or running your Playwright Check Suite as monitor.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  testCommand: "npx playwright test --grep@checkly --config=playwright.foo.config.ts",
})
```

<Info>If you configure the `testCommand` property and `pwTags` or `pwProjects` the options will be merged and all configurations applied to `npx playwright test`.</Info>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pwProjects" type="string">

The defined projects to run from your Playwright configuration.

**Usage:**

<CodeGroup>

```ts Single project highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwProjects: "chromium",
})
```

```ts Multiple projects highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwProjects: ["chromium", "firefox"],
})
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>[Playwright Test Projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) let you run different test files in different browsers and with different settings. They're the recommended way to group and bundle test functionality.</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pwTags" type="string">

The tags to filter which tests to run using Playwright's grep functionality.

Tests matching any of these tags will be executed.

**Usage:**

<CodeGroup>

```ts Single project highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwTags: "@smoke",
})
```

```ts Multiple projects highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwTags: ["@smoke", "@critical"],
})
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>Learn more about test tags and annotations in [the Playwright annotation docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#annotate-tests).</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="include" type="string">

The file patterns to include when bundling the Playwright Check Suite. Use this option to include test files, utilities, and other assets that aren't automatically discovered.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={4}
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  include: ['.npmrc']
})
```

<Info>
The Playwright Check Suite bundling process uses a breadth-first search algorithm starting from the entrypoint to recursively find all local file dependencies. It parses `import`/`require` statements and follows the dependency graph to include all necessary files.

Use `include` to bundle files that are not directly imported/required.
</Info>

</ResponseField>

### General Check Options

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
