Checkly is a comprehensive Application Reliability platform that enables teams to **test, monitor, and observe** their web applications, APIs, and other services in a unified workflow. Built for modern development teams, Checkly uses Monitoring as Code to help integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to catch issues before they reach production.

**The platform combines three core reliability capabilities:**

## Why Checkly?

Checkly helps developers increase uptime and reliability, improve shipping velocity, and improve incident response time of all sizes through a unified workflow that's scalable, automated, and AI-ready. Teams most often choose Checkly for:

<CardGroup cols={1}>

<Card title="Monitoring as Code" icon="code" horizontal>
Instead of installing an intrusive, overreaching agent into each one of your applications and services or using a bulky, limited UI that builds monitors, Checkly enables engineers to configure their entire monitoring process as code - from setting up and running monitors, to defining their alert thresholds and sequences - using the languages and tools they use everyday.
</Card>

<Card title="Native end-to-end reliability with Playwright" icon="play" horizontal>
Our browser monitoring is powered natively by Playwright, the world's most popular open-source testing framework. It's incredibly fast, robust, and reliable and enables engineers to easily build tests that can monitor fully replicated end-to-end scenarios.
</Card>

<Card title="Delightful Developer Experience" icon="smile" horizontal>
Checkly is a code-driven platform with all the APIs, SDKs, and integrations that your engineering team needs to program their entire observability process. The Checkly CLI allows engineers to build, test, and deploy their monitors using Git to manage the entire lifecycle management.
</Card>

<Card title="Unified Testing, Monitoring, Tracing, and Incident Management" icon="layers" horizontal>
Checkly brings application reliability together in a single user interface by uniting testing, monitoring, and observability using technologies like Playwright and Open Telemetry. Validate each deploy as it happens, catching bugs before they go live. Checkly will be your reliability platform along the development cycle from first deploy to production.
</Card>

<Card title="Reliable Functional and Performance Error Detection" icon="shield" horizontal>
Checkly accurately detects both functional and performance errors in pre-production and production environments. This helps consolidate tooling and improving the velocity of teams shipping quality features and services - the result of confidently understanding the entire picture of their applications health.

## Checkly Is Best Fit For
**DevOps and SRE Teams** looking for programmable monitoring that integrates seamlessly with their existing infrastructure-as-code and GitOps workflows.

**Full-Stack Engineering Teams** who want to shift monitoring left and treat monitoring as an integral part of their development process rather than an afterthought.

**Engineering Teams Using Modern Web Technologies** who want monitoring that understands modern JavaScript frameworks, SPAs, and API-first architectures.
