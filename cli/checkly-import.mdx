The `checkly import` command imports existing resources from your Checkly account into your CLI-managed project. This allows you to bring existing checks, alert channels, and other resources under code management using a structured three-phase workflow.

## Usage

Import all resources from your account into the current project.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import
```

## Extended Usage

Import all resources into a specific directory using the root option.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import --root ./src/checks
```

Import specific resources by providing their type and ID as arguments.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import check:abc123 alert-channel:456
```

Import using a specific configuration file for different environments.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import --config ./checkly.staging.config.ts
```

## Unique Options

### `--root`
Specify the directory where generated code should be placed.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import --root ./monitoring
```

**Default**: Uses the `checkMatch` directory defined in your `checkly.config.ts/js`.

### Resource Type Selection
Import specific resources by providing `resource-type:id` arguments:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import check:abc123 alert-channel:def456
```

**Available resource types**:
- `check` - Individual monitoring checks
- `check-group` - Collections of related checks  
- `alert-channel` - Notification channels
- `maintenance-window` - Scheduled maintenance periods
- `private-location` - Custom monitoring locations
- `dashboard` - Public status dashboards
- `snippet` - Reusable code snippets
- `status-page` - Status page configurations
- `status-page-service` - Status page service definitions

## Import Workflow

The import process follows a three-phase workflow for safe resource migration:

### 1. Plan Generation
Analyze your account and generate an import plan showing what will be imported.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import
```

### 2. Plan Application  
Apply the generated plan, creating code files for your resources.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import apply
```

### 3. Plan Commitment
Commit the applied changes and mark resources as CLI-managed.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import commit  
```

## Subcommands

### `checkly import apply`
Apply a previously generated import plan to create the actual code files in your project structure.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import apply
```

### `checkly import commit`
Commit an applied import plan to finalize the import and mark resources as managed by your CLI project.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import commit
```

### `checkly import cancel`
Cancel a generated plan that hasn't been committed to discard any pending import operations.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import cancel
```

## Import Process Example

Complete example showing the full three-phase workflow:

```bash Terminal        
# 1. Generate import plan
npx checkly import
# Output shows: "Found 15 checks, 3 alert channels, 1 check group"

# 2. Review and apply the plan
npx checkly import apply
# Output: "Created 19 files in ./src/checks/"

# 3. Commit the changes
npx checkly import commit
# Output: "Import completed. Resources now managed by CLI."
```

## Generated Code Structure

Imported resources are converted to CLI constructs with organized directory structure:

```
src/checks/
├── api-checks/
│   ├── homepage-api.check.ts
│   └── user-login-api.check.ts
├── browser-checks/
│   ├── checkout-flow.check.ts
│   └── user-dashboard.check.ts
├── alert-channels/
│   ├── slack-alerts.ts
│   └── email-notifications.ts
└── check-groups/
    └── production-monitoring.group.ts
```

## Environment Variable Targeting

Use environment-specific imports for different deployment stages:

### Staging Environment Import
```bash Terminal
npx checkly import \
  --config ./checkly.staging.config.ts \
  --env ENVIRONMENT=staging
```

### Production Environment Import
```bash Terminal
npx checkly import \
  --config ./checkly.production.config.ts \
  --env ENVIRONMENT=production
```

## Selective Import Strategy

For large accounts, consider importing incrementally to manage complexity:

Import critical checks first by check group.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import check-group:production
```

Import alert channels to establish notification infrastructure.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import alert-channel:slack alert-channel:email
```

Import remaining resources after establishing core infrastructure.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly import
```

## Best Practices

### Before Importing
1. **Backup existing project** structure
2. **Review your account** resources to understand what will be imported
3. **Plan directory structure** using `--root` if needed
4. **Test with specific resources** first using `resource-type:id` syntax

### After Importing
1. **Review generated code** for accuracy and style consistency
2. **Test imported checks** using `checkly test`
3. **Commit to version control** to track changes
4. **Deploy to verify** everything works as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Resource Conflicts
If resources already exist in your project, the import will show conflicts in the plan. Review carefully before applying.

### Permission Issues
Ensure your account has sufficient permissions to read all resources you're trying to import.

### Large Account Import
For accounts with many resources, consider using the selective import approach to manage complexity.
