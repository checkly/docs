## Overview

The Delete Multistep Check endpoint permanently removes a multistep API monitoring check from your account. This action cannot be undone and will stop all workflow monitoring for the deleted check.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Check Cleanup
- Workflow Monitoring Decommissioning
- Resource Management
- API Process Retirement

<Warning>
Deleting multistep checks is permanent and cannot be undone. All historical workflow data and transaction metrics will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

<Note>
Consider deactivating checks instead of deleting them to preserve historical workflow monitoring data and transaction performance trends.
