sidebarTitle: 'Creating Your First Monitor'

This guide walks you through creating your first URL monitor to check the availability and performance of your websites, APIs, or any HTTP-based service.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Create from UI">

Each URL monitor is defined by its request configuration, which includes the target URL and how its availability and performance should be validated.

### Basic Setup

Configure your URL monitor by specifying the endpoint and request method:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-entry.png" alt="URL monitor setup interface showing HTTP method selection, URL input field, and options for Skip SSL and Follow redirects" />
</Frame>

* **Request method:** Always `GET`
* **URL:** The HTTP(S) URL to monitor (e.g. `https://api.example.com`)
* **IP family:** Defaults to IPv4

### Response Validation

#### Assertions
Validate the returned response status code:

</Frame>

#### Response Time Limits
Define performance thresholds for degraded or failed states:

</Frame>

### Frequency

Set how often the monitor runs (every 10 seconds to 24 hours).

</Frame>


### Scheduling & Locations

</Frame>

* **Scheduling:** Choose between round-robin or parallel execution. Learn more about [scheduling strategies](/docs/monitoring/global-locations#scheduling-strategies)
* **Locations:** Select one or more [public](/docs/monitoring/global-locations/) or [private](/docs/private-locations/) locations to run the monitor from

### Additional Settings

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/docs/maintenance-windows/)
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/docs/alerting-and-retries/retries/)
* **Alerting:** Configure your [alert settings](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-settings/), [alert channels](/docs/alerting-and-retries/alert-channels/), or set up [webhooks](/docs/alerting-and-retries/webhooks/) for custom integrations

With the [Checkly CLI](/cli/overview), you can define URL monitors in TypeScript or JavaScript and manage them as code. See [CLI configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/cli-configuration) for comprehensive examples and advanced patterns.

```ts hello-url.check.ts
import { UrlMonitor, UrlAssertionBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

new UrlMonitor('hello-url-1', {
  name: 'Hello URL',
  activated: true,
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://welcome.checklyhq.com',
    assertions: [
      UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200),
    ]
  }
})

```js hello-url.check.js
const { UrlMonitor, UrlAssertionBuilder } = require('checkly/constructs')

new UrlMonitor('hello-url-1', {
  name: 'Hello URL',

  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://welcome.checklyhq.com',
    assertions: [

    ]
