## Overview

The Trigger Group Execution endpoint allows you to manually execute all checks within a specific check group. This is useful for comprehensive testing of related services and batch validation.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Group Testing
- Service Validation
- Deployment Testing
- Batch Health Checks

<Note>
Group triggers execute all checks in the group simultaneously. This may result in multiple check executions and count toward your account's execution limits.
