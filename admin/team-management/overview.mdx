This section covers all aspects of administering your Checkly account, from managing team members and permissions to setting up advanced security features and API access.

## Team Member Roles

When inviting a team member to join your account you can assign one of five roles: **Owner**, **Admin**, **Read & Write**, **Read & Run**, or **Read Only**. Each role inherits all permissions from the roles below it.

Only the initial account creator has the Owner role. You can change assigned roles at any time after a teammate joins.
