The `checkly deploy` command deploys all your checks and associated resources like alert channels to your Checkly account. This command synchronizes your local monitoring-as-code configuration with your Checkly account.

## Usage

Deploy all resources to your Checkly account.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy
```

## Extended Usage

Preview the differences between your local configuration and your account before deploying.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

Deploy without confirmation and show applied differences after deployment.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --force --output
```

Deploy using a specific configuration file without triggering check runs.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --config="./checkly.staging.config.ts" --no-schedule-on-deploy
```

## Unique Options

### `--preview` or `-p`
Preview the differences between your local configuration and your Checkly account without making any changes.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

Shows you exactly what will be added, modified, or removed during deployment.

### `--output` or `-o`
Show applied differences after deploying, providing a summary of what was changed.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --output
```

### `--debug-bundle`
Generate a JSON file containing the data sent to Checkly servers when deploying. Useful for debugging configuration issues.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy --debug-bundle
```

Creates a `checkly-bundle-debug.json` file in your project directory.

### `--no-schedule-on-deploy`
Prevent checks from running automatically when they are deployed.

```bash Terminal        
npx checkly deploy --no-schedule-on-deploy
```

Useful when you want to deploy changes but delay execution until later.

## Git Integration

When you deploy a project, you can attach Git-specific information so changes to any resources are displayed in the Checkly web UI with the correct commit, branch, and author information.

The following Git variables are automatically detected from your local or CI environment:

- `CHECKLY_GIT_REPO_URL` - Repository URL
- `CHECKLY_GIT_BRANCH` - Current branch
- `CHECKLY_GIT_COMMIT_SHA` - Commit hash
- `CHECKLY_GIT_COMMIT_MESSAGE` - Commit message
- `CHECKLY_GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_NAME` - Author name
- `CHECKLY_GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` - Author email

You can also set these manually as environment variables if automatic detection doesn't work in your environment.
