<Tip>
**Monitoring as Code**: Learn more about the [URL Monitor Construct](/constructs/url-monitor).
</Tip>

URL monitors track the availability of your HTTP-based services by sending requests to specified URLs and validating responses, performance, and content.

**Typical use cases include:**

* Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
* Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
* Checking that your SSL certificate is still valid
* Confirming that a public pricing endpoint is reachable for customers

## Configuration Options

### Basic Setup

Monitor any URL by specifying the endpoint you want to track. You can configure the HTTP method, add request headers, and set SSL/redirect options:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-entry.png" alt="URL monitor setup interface showing HTTP method selection, URL input field, and options for Skip SSL and Follow redirects" />
</Frame>

### Assertions

Use assertions to validate the status code of your URL request. When one or more assertions fail, an alert is triggered:

**Status Code**
Verify your endpoint returns the expected HTTP status code using the comparison dropdown:

- **Equals**: Exact status code match (e.g., 200)
- **Not Equals**: Any status except specified code
- **Greater Than**: Status code above threshold  
- **Less Than**: Status code below threshold

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('api-monitor', {
  name: 'API Health Check',
  url: 'https://api.example.com/health',
  assertions: [
    UrlAssertionBuilder.statusCode().equals(200)
  ]
})
```

### Response Time Limits

Set performance thresholds to ensure your application meets speed requirements:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Degraded Performance">
**Degraded After**: Time threshold (in milliseconds) after which the check is marked as degraded but not failed.

- Default: 5000ms (5 seconds)  
- Use for: Performance warnings without triggering failure alerts
- Example: Mark as degraded if response takes longer than 2 seconds

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('fast-api', {
  name: 'Fast API Monitor',
  url: 'https://api.example.com/fast-endpoint',
  degradedResponseTime: 2000, // 2 seconds
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Failed Performance">
**Failed After**: Time threshold after which the check fails completely.

- Default: 30000ms (30 seconds)
- Use for: Hard performance limits
- Example: Fail if response takes longer than 10 seconds

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('timeout-test', {
  name: 'Critical Service Monitor', 
  url: 'https://critical-service.com/api',
  maxResponseTime: 10000, // 10 seconds
})
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Frequency & Scheduling

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Check Frequency">
Determine how often your monitors run. Unlike Synthetic Monitors, URL Monitors do not consume "Checks" and can run at any frequency available to your plan:

**Available Frequencies:**
- Every 10 seconds (High-frequency plans only)
- Every 30 seconds  
- Every 1 minute
- Every 2 minutes
- Every 5 minutes (recommended for most use cases)
- Every 10 minutes
- Every 15 minutes
- Every 30 minutes
- Every 1 hour
- Every 2 hours
- Every 4 hours
- Every 8 hours
- Every 24 hours

```javascript
import { Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

const monitor = new UrlMonitor('frequent-check', {
  name: 'High Priority Monitor',
  url: 'https://critical-app.com',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scheduling Strategy">
Choose when and how your checks run:

**Round Robin** (Default)
- Checks run from one random location each interval
- Most cost-effective option
- Good for general availability monitoring

**Fixed Schedule**
- Checks run from all selected locations simultaneously
- Higher consumption but immediate global visibility
- Best for critical services requiring real-time global status

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('global-check', {
  name: 'Global Service Monitor',
  url: 'https://global-service.com',
  runParallel: true, // Enable fixed schedule
})
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Public Locations">
Checkly operates monitoring locations worldwide:

- N. California (us-west-1)
- Oregon (us-west-2)
- Montreal (ca-central-1)
- São Paulo (sa-east-1)

- London (eu-west-2)
- Paris (eu-west-3)
- Stockholm (eu-north-1)
- Milan (eu-south-1)

- Osaka (ap-northeast-3)
- Hong Kong (ap-east-1)
- Sydney (ap-southeast-2)
- Mumbai (ap-south-1)

  name: 'Worldwide Availability Check',
  url: 'https://global-app.com',
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1', 'ap-southeast-1'],
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Private Locations">
Run checks from your own infrastructure:

- Monitor internal applications and services
- Check applications behind firewalls or VPNs
- Maintain compliance with data residency requirements
- Get insights from the user's actual network perspective

[Set up Private Locations →](/docs/detect/private-locations/overview)
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Retry Strategy

Configure how Checkly handles failed checks:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="None">
No retries - fail immediately on first failure:
- Fastest failure detection
- May result in false positives from temporary network issues
- Best for: Non-critical monitors or when immediate alerting is required
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fixed">
Retry a specific number of times with consistent intervals:
- Predictable retry behavior
- Good balance between speed and reliability
- Configurable retry count and delay

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('reliable-check', {
  name: 'Stable Service Monitor',
  url: 'https://stable-service.com',
  retryStrategy: {
    type: 'fixed',
    baseBackoffSeconds: 60,
    maxRetries: 2,
  }
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Linear">
Increase retry delay linearly with each attempt:
- Gradually increases delay between retries
- Prevents overwhelming failed services
- Good for services that may need time to recover

```javascript
retryStrategy: {
  type: 'linear',
  baseBackoffSeconds: 60,
  maxRetries: 3,
  sameRegion: true
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Exponential">
Double the retry delay with each attempt:
- Most conservative retry approach
- Maximum protection against service overload
- Best for critical services or those with rate limiting

```javascript
retryStrategy: {
  type: 'exponential', 
  baseBackoffSeconds: 60,
  maxRetries: 3,
  maxDurationSeconds: 600
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Alert Settings

Configure notifications for your team:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Global Alert Settings">
Use your account's default alert configuration:

- Inherits all configured alert channels
- Consistent alerting across all monitors
- Easier to manage at scale

```javascript
const monitor = new UrlMonitor('standard-alerts', {
  name: 'Standard Monitor',
  url: 'https://service.com',
  // Uses global alert settings automatically
})
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Alert Settings">
Override global settings for specific monitors:

- Target specific teams or channels
- Different escalation policies
- Custom alert thresholds

```javascript
import { EmailAlertChannel } from 'checkly/constructs'

const criticalAlerts = new EmailAlertChannel('critical-team', {
  address: 'critical-team@company.com'
})

const monitor = new UrlMonitor('critical-service', {
  name: 'Critical Service Monitor',
  url: 'https://critical-service.com',
  alertChannels: [criticalAlerts],
})
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
