Regardless of the provider or platform you use, integrating Checkly into your CI/CD pipeline boils down to **four basic steps**:

1. Store your checks as code and `git push`. Preferably store your checks alongside your application code. Just like unit tests.
2. Wait for your application to be deployed. This can be done through hooks, lifecycle events or wait scripts.
3. Run your checks using `npx checkly test` and pass in any variables like an `ENVIRONMENT_URL`.
4. If the checks pass successfully, run `npx checkly deploy`.

With this approach, you can validate your application and infrastructure before deploying to production, staging or any other environments.
Simultaneously , you can life cycle (create/update/delete) your checks from your code base as part of your CI/CD workflow.
## CI/CD Integration with the Checkly CLI

The preferred and most flexible way to integrate Checkly with your CI/CD is through the [Checkly CLI](/cli).

## CI/CD Basics
We've optimized the [Checkly CLI](/cli) to work in any CI/CD workflow. Here are the basics you need to know that
will come in handy when adapting the examples we give you to your own, specific setup.

1. For **authentication**, make sure to set the `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` parameters as environment variables
in your CI/CD platform.
2. Set the **reporter** you want to use for the `test` command using the `--reporter` flag, i.e. `--reporter=dot`.
3. To store a **test session** with full logging, traces and vides, set the `--record` flag for the `test` command.
4. Use the `--force` flag on the `deploy` and / or `destroy` commands to skip the normal confirmation steps.

When using the `--record` flag, the CLI will attempt to parse `git` specific information from
the environment to display in the recorded test session as metadata. However, you can also set these data items specifically
by using environment variables.
