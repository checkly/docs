The `checkly destroy` command removes all resources associated with your project from your Checkly account, including checks, check groups, alert channels, maintenance windows, and other project-defined resources.

## Usage

```bash
npx checkly destroy
```

Destroy all project resources with confirmation prompt.

## Extended Usage

```bash
npx checkly destroy --force
```
Destroy all project resources without confirmation (useful for CI/CD).

```bash
npx checkly destroy --config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"
```
Destroy resources defined in a specific configuration file.

## Unique Options

This command has no unique options - it uses only [global options](/cli-reference/global-options).

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli-reference/global-options):

- [`--config`](/cli-reference/global-options#config-or-c) - Specify a configuration file
- [`--force`](/cli-reference/global-options#force-or-f) - Skip confirmation dialogs

## What Gets Destroyed

The destroy command removes the following resources that were created by your project:

- **Checks** (API, Browser, Heartbeat, etc.)
- **Check Groups** and their configurations
- **Alert Channels** defined in your project
- **Maintenance Windows** created via CLI
- **Environment Variables** at the project level
- **Private Locations** (if managed by the project)
- **Snippets** and reusable code blocks

## Important Warnings

<Warning>
**Destructive Operation**: This command permanently deletes resources from your Checkly account. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Shared Resources**: Be careful with shared resources like alert channels that might be used by other projects or manually created checks.
</Warning>

## Safety Considerations

### Confirmation Dialog
By default, the command prompts for confirmation:
```
⚠️  This will destroy all resources in your Checkly project.
Are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
```

### CI/CD Usage
For automated environments, use `--force` to skip confirmation:
```bash
npx checkly destroy --force
```

### Backup Recommendation
Before destroying, consider:
1. **Exporting configuration** to preserve setup
2. **Documenting dependencies** on shared resources
3. **Checking team coordination** to avoid conflicts
