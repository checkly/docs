<Tip>
**Monitoring as Code**: Learn more about the [Private Location Construct](/constructs/private-location).
</Tip>

<Note>
**Owner** or **Admin** permissions are required to create, edit, and delete Private Locations. All other roles can view Private Locations and assign checks to them.
</Note>

Private Locations enable you to run Checkly monitoring from within your own infrastructure. By deploying a lightweight Checkly Agent, you can monitor internal systems, test from specific geographic locations, and maintain complete control over your monitoring environment.

A Private Location is a custom monitoring location that you control by deploying Checkly Agent containers in your infrastructure. These agents connect securely to Checkly and execute your checks from within your network environment.

## How Private Locations Work

The process is straightforward and secure:

1. **Create a Private Location** in your Checkly account
2. **Deploy Checkly Agents** using the provided API key
3. **Configure your checks** to use your Private Location
4. **Monitor results** just like any other Checkly check

## Key Benefits

### Network-Level Access

Private Locations run inside your network perimeter, giving you access to:
- Internal APIs and services not exposed to the internet
- Development and staging environments
- Database connections and internal tools
- Services behind VPNs or private networks

### Geographic Flexibility

Deploy agents anywhere to get location-specific insights:
- Test from regions not covered by Checkly's global network
- Monitor from your actual data center locations
- Validate performance from specific customer regions
- Meet regulatory requirements for local testing

### Security and Compliance

Maintain complete control over your monitoring environment:
- Keep sensitive data within your network
- Meet compliance requirements for data residency
- Maintain audit trails within your infrastructure
- Use your existing security policies and controls

### Scalable and Resilient

Design for production workloads:
- Horizontal scaling with multiple agents
- Automatic load distribution across agents
- Graceful handling of agent failures
- Zero-downtime updates and maintenance


## Requirements

Before setting up Private Locations, ensure you have:

**Memory Guidelines:**
- API checks: ~150MB per concurrent check
- Browser checks: ~1.5GB per concurrent check
- Minimum recommended: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM for mixed workloads

## Agent Lifecycle Management

### Agent Status Monitoring

Checkly monitors agent connectivity and health:

- **Active**: Agent is connected and processing checks
- **Unavailable**: No agents connected for 10+ minutes
- **Degraded**: Some agents disconnected, reduced capacity

When a Private Location becomes unavailable, Checkly automatically:
- Stops scheduling new checks for that location
- Emails account owners and admins
- Resumes scheduling when agents reconnect

### Load Distribution

Multiple agents in the same Private Location automatically:
- Share check execution load
- Provide redundancy and high availability
- Handle graceful failover during agent restarts
- Requeue checks from failed agents (300-second timeout)
