## How Checkly deals with subscribers limits based on your plan

If you've purchased a Communicate Starter or Communicate Team add-on, **extra subscribers will automatically be charged as overages**. 
You can monitor your subscribers and overages from [your Checkly account billing page](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/billing).

If you have not purchased any Communicate add-on, we will continue accepting new subscribers to your page, yet will only send notifications to the first 250 subscribers. [View pricing for more details about limits](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing).
