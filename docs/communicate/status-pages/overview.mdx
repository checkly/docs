Status pages provide transparent communication about your service health and incidents to customers, users, and stakeholders. Checkly's status pages automatically reflect your monitoring results and create a professional interface for incident communication.


## Core Status Page Components

### Services
Services represent functional pieces of your application that users interact with:

```yaml
# Example service structure
Payment Processing:
  Description: "Credit card and payment processing"
  Connected Checks: [Payment API, Stripe Integration, PayPal API]
  Incident Automation: Enabled
  Status: Operational

User Authentication:
  Description: "Login and user management systems"
  Connected Checks: [Auth API, OAuth Service, User Database]
  Incident Automation: Enabled
  Status: Operational
```

### Service Cards
Organize and group services for better user experience:

- **Visual grouping**: Related services displayed together
- **Custom ordering**: Arrange services by importance or user impact
- **Status aggregation**: Overall health based on connected checks
- **Description management**: Clear service explanations for users

### Automatic Incident Management
Connect monitoring checks directly to services for automated incident handling:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="When Checks Fail" >
- Incident opened automatically
- Service status updated to "Major Outage" or "Partial Outage"
- Subscribers notified via email
- Status page reflects current state
</Card>

<Card title="When Checks Recover">
- Incident automatically resolved
- Service status returned to "Operational"
- Resolution notification sent to subscribers
- Historical record maintained
</Card>
</CardGroup>


## Incident Backfilling
Add historical incidents to maintain accurate status page history:

<Steps>
<Step title="Historical Accuracy">
Create incidents for past outages or maintenance windows
</Step>

<Step title="Custom Date Selection">
Set specific dates and times for historical incidents
</Step>

<Step title="Subscriber Management">
Choose whether to notify current subscribers about historical incidents
</Step>

<Step title="Uptime Calculation">
Backfilled incidents are included in uptime statistics
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
When backfilling historical incidents, consider whether to notify current subscribers. Usually, you want to disable notifications for historical events to avoid confusion.
