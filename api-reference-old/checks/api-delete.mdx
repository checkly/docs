## Overview

The Delete API Check endpoint permanently removes an API monitoring check from your account. This action cannot be undone and will stop all monitoring for the deleted check.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Check Cleanup
- Monitoring Decommissioning
- Resource Management
- API Deprecation

<Warning>
Deleting API checks is permanent and cannot be undone. All historical data, results, and alerting will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

<Note>
Consider deactivating checks instead of deleting them if you want to preserve historical monitoring data.
