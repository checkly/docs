</Frame>

Integrate Playwright test results with Checkly monitoring. Upload test results, screenshots, videos, and traces to gain visibility into your application's health across test runs.

**Fully compatible with Playwright's native JSON reporter** - use it as a drop-in replacement that adds Checkly integration.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before using the Playwright reporter, ensure you have:

- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- Playwright >= 1.40.0
- A Checkly account ([sign up](https://www.checklyhq.com/signup))
</Accordion>

## Install the Playwright Reporter

Install [the Playwright reporter package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@checkly/playwright-reporter) via npm.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @checkly/playwright-reporter
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an API key and get your Account ID

Authenticate the reporter with your Checkly Account ID and an API Key:

1. [Log in to Checkly](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Get your Account ID from [Account Settings > General](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general)
3. Create an API key in [User Settings > API Keys](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys)

Set your credentials as environment variables:

```bash
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_123...
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=b2f...
```

The reporter automatically detects `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variables.

<Tip>
Use inline environment variables if needed:

```bash
CHECKLY_API_KEY=... CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=... npx playwright test
```
</Tip>

### 2. Add the reporter to your Playwright configuration

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    createChecklyReporter(),
  ],
});
```

<Tip>
`createChecklyReporter()` provides full IntelliSense for configuration options. Alternatively, use array syntax: `['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {}]`
</Tip>

### 3. Run your tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You'll see real-time test progress and a session URL in the output:

```console

## Configuration

### Reporter Options

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    createChecklyReporter({
      // Directory for assets, JSON, and ZIP output
      outputDir: 'test-results',

      // Custom session name (string or function)
      sessionName: 'My Test Suite',
      // or: sessionName: () => `Build ${process.env.BUILD_NUMBER}`,

      // Skip upload, create local files only
      dryRun: false,

      // Enable debug logging
      verbose: false,

      // Show real-time test progress
      showProgress: true,

      // Show individual test steps
      printSteps: false,

      // Show per-project summary table
      showSummaryTable: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `outputDir` | `string` | Playwright's `outputDir` | Directory for output files |
| `sessionName` | `string \| function` | Auto-generated | Custom session name or function returning name |
| `dryRun` | `boolean` | `false` | Skip upload, create local files only |
| `verbose` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `showProgress` | `boolean` | `true` | Display real-time test progress |
| `printSteps` | `boolean` | `false` | Display individual test steps |
| `showSummaryTable` | `boolean` | `true` | Display per-project results table |

**Output files** (written to `outputDir`):
- `checkly-report.json` - JSON test report
- `checkly-report.zip` - ZIP archive with report and assets

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CHECKLY_API_KEY` | Your Checkly API key |
| `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Checkly account ID |
| `CHECKLY_REPORTER_VERBOSE` | Set to `true` for detailed debug output |

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Always use environment variables for credentials. Never commit API keys to version control.
</Warning>

## What Gets Uploaded

- Test results and status (passed/failed/flaky)
- Execution duration and timing
- Screenshots (on failure or explicit capture)
- Video recordings
- Playwright traces
- Console logs and network requests (extracted from traces)
- Git information (branch, commit, author) - automatically detected from CI or local git

<Tip>
If your Checkly reports don't include traces or videos, ensure that your `playwright.config.ts` enables these Playwright features. The reporter only uploads what your Playwright test run creates.
</Tip>

## Understanding Test Sessions

The reporter creates **suite-level test sessions**, not individual test file results.

When you run `npx playwright test`:

1. **One test session** is created for the entire run
2. **All test results** are grouped together
3. **All assets uploaded** in a single ZIP file

This provides a consolidated view of your test suite, efficient storage, and the ability to track overall pass/fail rates over time.

View your results at [app.checklyhq.com/test-sessions](https://app.checklyhq.com/test-sessions).

## Features

### Real-time Test Progress

Shows test results as they run with status icons and error details. Similar to Playwright's `list` reporter with Checkly integration.

Set `showProgress: false` when using another reporter for terminal output.

### Summary Table

Displays a summary table with per-project breakdown of test results. Set `showSummaryTable: false` to disable.

```console
Project   Total  Pass  Fail  Flaky  Skip  Rate
chromium     10     9     0      1     0  90.00%
firefox      10    10     0      0     0  100.00%
webkit       10     8     2      0     0  80.00%
```

### Multi-Provider Git Detection

Automatically detects git information (branch, commit, author) from:

- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI
- Jenkins, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket Pipelines
- Local git repository (when running locally)

### Test Step Code Snippets

Includes source code context in test step reports. View the exact line of code that executed with surrounding context for easier debugging.

## Dry Run Mode

Skip uploading to Checkly while still generating local files:

**Without credentials** (automatic skip):
```bash
# Don't set CHECKLY_API_KEY or CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
npx playwright test
```

**With `dryRun` option** (explicit skip):
```ts playwright.config.ts
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: true,
})
```

**Upload only in CI**:
```ts playwright.config.ts
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: !process.env.CI,
})
```

Both approaches create `checkly-report.json` and `checkly-report.zip` in your output directory for local inspection.

## Multiple Reporters

Combine with other Playwright reporters:

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    createChecklyReporter(),
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['list'],
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results/junit.xml' }],
  ],
});
```

## Troubleshooting

### Missing traces or videos

Ensure your `playwright.config.ts` enables these features:

```ts playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    trace: 'retain-on-failure',
  },
});
```

See [Playwright's trace options](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer#recording-a-trace) and [video options](https://playwright.dev/docs/videos) for all configuration options.

### Authentication errors

Verify your environment variables are set correctly:

```bash
echo $CHECKLY_API_KEY
echo $CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
```

If empty, set them before running tests:

```bash
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_123...
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=b2f...
```

### Upload failures

- Enable verbose logging with `verbose: true` or `CHECKLY_REPORTER_VERBOSE=true` for detailed error messages
- Verify your API key exists in [Checkly API Keys settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/accounts/settings/user/api-keys)
