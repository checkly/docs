The `checkly switch` command switches between multiple Checkly accounts that you have access to with your current credentials. Useful when you need to manage monitoring across different organizations or environments.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before using `checkly switch`, ensure you have:

- Valid Checkly account authentication (run `npx checkly login` if needed)
- Access to multiple Checkly accounts (team memberships, client projects, etc.)

If you only have access to one account, this command will indicate no alternative accounts are available.
</Accordion>

## Usage

The basic command displays available accounts and provides an interactive selection interface.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly switch [options]
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--account-id, -a` | The id of the account you want to switch to. |


## Command Options

<ResponseField name="--account-id, -a" type="string">

The `switch` command asks you to select an account interactively by default. Use this option to switch accounts non-interactively by specifying the target account ID directly.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly switch --account-id="a43....."
npx checkly switch -a="a43....."
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Alternative Accounts
If you see "No alternative accounts available":
- You only have access to one Checkly account
- Contact account administrators to request access to additional accounts
- Consider using separate authentication for different accounts

### Account Not Listed
If an expected account doesn't appear:
- Verify you have active access to that account
- Check that your user hasn't been removed from the account
- Try logging out and back in to refresh account permissions
