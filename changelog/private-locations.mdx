### Version 6.1.2 (August 6, 2025)

**Features**

- Add support for CHECKLY_SECRET environment variables
  - When an environment variable prefixed with `CHECKLY_SECRET_` contains special characters (anything other than A-Za-z0-9-_.~), the system now:
    1. Detects special characters using the regex pattern `/[^A-Za-z0-9\-_.~]/`
    2. Creates an encoded version using `encodeURIComponent()` with additional `!` character encoding (%21)
    3. Adds it to the scrubbing cache to ensure both original and encoded values are properly scrubbed from traces
  - This ensures that secrets containing special characters like `@, %, !, +`, etc. are properly scrubbed even when they appear in encoded form within request payloads or URLs
