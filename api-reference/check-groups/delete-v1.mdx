## Overview

The Delete Check Group endpoint permanently removes a check group from your account. This action deletes the group but preserves individual checks, which become ungrouped.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Group Cleanup
- Organization Restructuring
- Resource Management
- Group Decommissioning

<Warning>
Deleting check groups is permanent. Member checks will become ungrouped but remain active. Group-specific settings and configurations will be lost.
</Warning>

<Note>
Individual checks are preserved when deleting groups. Consider reassigning checks to other groups before deletion if group organization is important.
