The phone numbers used for phone call alerting need to be in [E.164 format](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164). Stick to the following rules, and you'll be fine:

- Prepend international access codes with a + sign
- Do not use any white spaces
- Use up to 15 characters

You can add as many phone number channels as you like.
