Checkly is a comprehensive Application Reliability platform that enables teams to **test, monitor, and observe** their web applications, APIs, and other services in a unified workflow. Built for modern development teams, Checkly uses Monitoring as Code to help integrate directly into CI/CD pipelines, allowing you to catch issues before they reach production.

**The platform combines three core reliability capabilities:**

## Why Checkly?

Checkly helps developers increase uptime and reliability, improve shipping velocity, and improve incident response time through a unified workflow that's scalable, automated, and AI-ready. Teams most often choose Checkly for:

<CardGroup cols={1}>

<Card title="Monitoring as Code" icon="code" horizontal>
Instead of monitoring being configured through a bulky, limited UI that is slow to keep up with the pace of development, Checkly enables engineers to build and configure their entire monitoring process **Typescript constructs**.

</Card>

<Card title="Native end-to-end reliability with Playwright" icon="play" horizontal>
Our browser monitoring is powered natively by Playwright, the world's most popular open-source testing framework. It's incredibly fast, robust, and reliable and enables engineers to easily build tests that can monitor fully replicated end-to-end scenarios.

</Card>

<Card title="Delightful Developer Experience" icon="square-code" horizontal>
Checkly is a code-driven platform with all the constructs, APIs, and integrations that your engineering team needs to automate & program their entire observability process. The Checkly CLI manages the entire lifecycle of your monitors.

## Checkly Is Best Fit For
**DevOps and SRE Teams** looking for programmable monitoring that integrates seamlessly with their existing infrastructure-as-code and GitOps workflows.

**Full-Stack Engineering Teams** who want to shift monitoring left and treat monitoring as an integral part of their development process rather than an afterthought.

**Engineering Teams Using Modern Web Technologies** who want monitoring that understands modern JavaScript frameworks, SPAs, and API-first architectures.
