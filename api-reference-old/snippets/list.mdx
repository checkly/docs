## Overview

The List Snippets endpoint returns all reusable code snippets available in your Checkly account. Snippets are reusable pieces of code that can be shared across multiple checks to maintain consistency and reduce duplication.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Code Reusability Management
- Shared Function Libraries
- Template Discovery
- Code Organization

<Note>
Snippets help maintain consistency across checks and reduce code duplication. Use them for common functions, authentication logic, and shared utilities.
