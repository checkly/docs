Every script that we will write will almost certainly do three key things:
1. Navigating to some web page
2. Waiting for something
3. Possibly getting a timeout 😐



## Navigating

Initial navigation to any page can happen in multiple ways.

- Whenever your code does a `page.goto()`, or a `page.click()` on a link, you explicitly trigger a navigation.
- The webpage you are on can also trigger a navigation by executing `location.href= 'https://example.com'` or using the
`history.pushState()` API.

In the example below we trigger two navigations:

1. The initial load of the page.
2. A navigation to the shopping cart by clicking a link

```ts basic-browser-navigation.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('basic navigation', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://danube-web.shop/')
  await page.click('#cart')
})

```


Run this example as follows:
```bash
npx playwright test basic-browser-navigation.spec.ts
```

## Waiting

Waiting for something to happen is a crucial part of any automation script. In most cases, this is handled automatically
by Playwright. For example, when you click a button, Playwright will wait for that button to be clickable before it actually clicks it.

In the example below, we type an email address into an input field on a login modal. Playwright's `fill` method comes with
built-in waiting functionality.

```ts basic-browser-waiting.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('basic built-in waiting', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://danube-web.shop/')
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Log in' }).click()
  await page.getByPlaceholder('Email').click()
  await page.getByPlaceholder('Email').fill('test@test.com')
})

```
Run this example as follows:

```bash
npx playwright test basic-browser-waiting.spec.ts
```

Playwright actions perform so-called [actionability checks](https://playwright.dev/docs/actionability#introduction) before interacting with DOM elements.

If you call `click()` on a locator, Playwright will ensure that:

- your locator resolves to exactly one element.
- the matching element is visible.
- the matching element is stable.
- the matching element can receive events and is not covered or obscured by other elements.
- the matching element is enabled.

Playwright's auto-waiting and actionability checks allow you to focus on the end-to-end test flow without worrying when and if elements become visible. Playwright evaluates this for you.

## Timeouts

The `page.waitForNavigation()` method — but also similar methods like `page.reload()` and `page.goBack()` — all take some
options that determine "how" it should wait and what the timeout limits are.

These options come in two flavors:

**1. Hard timeout**

The time in milliseconds passed as the `timeout` property e.g.
`page.waitForNavigation({ timeout: 2000 })`. We do not recommend
using this if you do not explicitly need to.

**2a. DOM event based**

These two options are directly related to the events your browser emits when it has reached a certain loading stage.


- `load`: This is the `page.goto()` default and very strict: your whole page including all dependent resources, i.e. images, scripts, css etc.
- `domcontentloaded`: less strict: when your HTML has loaded.

**2b. Heuristic based**

This option is based on the heuristic that if (almost) all network connections your browser has are no longer active,
your page has probably finished loading.

- `networkidle`: consider navigation to be finished when there are no more than 0 network connections for at least 500 ms.

<Warning>Relying on `networkidle` is discouraged because it slows down your end-to-end tests. It's recommended to rely on auto-waiting and application state to evaluate when a page is ready.</Warning>
