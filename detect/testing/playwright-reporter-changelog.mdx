## Full release history

<Update label="v1.5.0" tags={["February 2026"]}>
  **Added**

  - **Test command** - The test command is now automatically detected and shown in the Checkly UI. Override with the `testCommand` option or `CHECKLY_TEST_COMMAND` env var.
  - **Job logs** - CI job logs are now included in test session uploads.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.4.2" tags={["February 2026"]}>
  **Fixed**

  - Missing credentials now show a clean warning instead of a stack trace. Other reporters continue working normally.

  **Changed**

  - Improved summary table format.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.4.1" tags={["February 2026"]}>
  **Critical Bug Fix**

  **1.4.0 is deprecated. Use this version.**

  - Fixed npm install failing with 404 error due to missing dependency.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.4.0" tags={["February 2026"]}>
  **Added**

  - **Secret scrubbing** - Automatically scrub sensitive values from reports and trace files. Configure via the new `scrubbing` option:
    - `envVars`: Array of environment variable names whose values should be scrubbed
    - `autoDetect`: Auto-detect secrets from env vars matching common patterns (SECRET, KEY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, CREDENTIAL, AUTH, PRIVATE, API)
    - `replacement`: Custom replacement string (default: `*********`)
    - Set `scrubbing: false` to disable scrubbing entirely

  ```typescript
  createChecklyReporter({
    scrubbing: {
      envVars: ['API_KEY', 'DB_PASSWORD'],
      autoDetect: true,
      replacement: '[REDACTED]'
    }
  })
  ```

  - **Improved network and console data** - Network requests now include detailed fields (domain, resource type, headers, timing, transfer/resource bytes). Console logs include location information. Resource types are automatically derived from Content-Type headers when not available.

  **Changed**

  - **Playwright 1.58 support** - Now tested against Playwright 1.58.0.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.3.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  **Real-time test progress** - Shows test results as they run with status icons, error details, and summary. Similar to Playwright's `list` reporter. Disable with `showProgress: false` if using another reporter.

  **Summary table** - Displays per-project breakdown of test results with pass/fail/flaky/skip counts and pass rates. Disable with `showSummaryTable: false`.

  **Automatic git detection** - Automatically detects git information (branch, commit, author) in CI environments and locally.

  **Test step code snippets** - Includes source code context in test step reports. View the exact line of code that executed with surrounding context for easier debugging.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.2.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  **Breaking Changes**

  **Credentials now required** - Reporter requires Checkly credentials (`apiKey` + `accountId`) or explicit `dryRun: true`. Missing credentials now show clear error messages instead of silently skipping upload.

  If you're not using Checkly Test Sessions, add `dryRun: true` to your config:

  ```typescript
  reporter: [['@checkly/playwright-reporter', { dryRun: true }]]
  ```

  **Added**

  **Improved error messages** for credential issues:
  - Shows both config option and environment variable (e.g., "apiKey / CHECKLY_API_KEY")
  - Includes direct link to API keys settings page
  - Invalid API keys display "Authentication failed"
  - Wrong account IDs display "Access denied" with guidance
</Update>

<Update label="v1.1.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  > **Note:** This minor version contains breaking changes. Options API configurations in 1.0.x could lead to broken states, so we published this as a minor version and unpublished previous 1.0.x releases.

  **Breaking Changes**

  **Removed deprecated options** - The following options are no longer supported and will throw an error if used:
  - `outputFile` - Use `outputDir` instead
  - `testResultsDir` - Use `outputDir` instead
  - `outputPath` - Use `outputDir` instead

  **Changed**

  **Simplified options API** - Introduced cleaner configuration:
  - `outputDir` - Directory for all output (JSON report and ZIP assets)
  - `verbose` - Enable debug logging
  - `apiKey` - Checkly API key (or use `CHECKLY_API_KEY` env var)
  - `accountId` - Checkly account ID (or use `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` env var)
  - `sessionName` - Custom session name (string or function)
  - `dryRun` - Generate report without uploading

  **Migration from 1.0.x**

  If you were using any deprecated options, update your configuration:

  ```diff
  // playwright.config.ts
  export default defineConfig({
    reporter: [
  -   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {
  -     outputFile: 'results/report.json',
  -     testResultsDir: 'test-results',
  -   }],
  +   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {
  +     outputDir: 'results'
  +   }],
    ],
  })
  ```
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.4" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  - Fixed module loading issues in certain Playwright configurations
  - Reduced package size
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.3" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  - Fixed compatibility with Playwright's TypeScript configuration loading mechanism
  - Reporter version now correctly displays in test session summary
  - `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable is now properly read for all features
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.2" tags={["January 2026"]}>
  - Test session creation is now properly awaited before uploading results, fixing intermittent upload failures in CI environments
  - Sharded test execution now works correctly when using `playwright merge-reports` command
  - Default projects now preserve their empty name correctly
  - Output types now re-export from `@playwright/test/reporter` with Checkly augmentations for `_checkly` property
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.0" tags={["January 2025"]}>
  First stable release of the rewritten Playwright reporter with extension-based architecture.

  **Added**

  - **Extension-based architecture** - Modular design allows for composable functionality
  - **Broad Playwright support** - Compatible with Playwright versions 1.40 through 1.57+
  - **Drop-in JSON replacement** - Fully compatible with Playwright's native JSON reporter output format
  - **Trace extraction** - Automatically extracts console messages and network requests from Playwright trace files
  - **Checkly integration** - Automatic upload to Checkly Test Sessions when credentials are configured
  - **New `createChecklyReporter()` function** - Better IntelliSense support in `playwright.config.ts`
  - **Unified `outputDir` option** - Single option for all output files (JSON report, ZIP assets)
  - **Verbose logging** - Debug mode for troubleshooting report generation

  **Migration from 0.x**

  ```diff
  // playwright.config.ts
  +import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter'

  export default defineConfig({
    reporter: [
  -   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', { outputFile: 'results/report.json' }],
  +   createChecklyReporter({ outputDir: 'results' }),
    ],
  })
  ```

  The legacy 0.x reporter remains available via `npm install @checkly/playwright-reporter@legacy`.
</Update>
