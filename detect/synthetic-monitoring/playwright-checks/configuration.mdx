<PlaywrightCheckSuiteBetaNote />

Use the `checkly.config.ts/js` file to define your Playwright Check Suite. Each Playwright Check Suite can be connected to references in your `playwright.config.ts/js` file.

<Info>
During the Beta, **a Playwright Check Suite can run up to 20 minutes**. This limit can be adjusted based on feedback.

## Playwright Check Suite definition

To add Playwright Check Suites to your Checkly monitoring setup, specify the path to your `playwright.config.ts/js` and add a new `playwrightChecks` property to the existing `checks` configuration in your `checkly.config.ts/js`.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={8-14}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'
import { Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...

  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'all-pwt-tests',
        locicalId: 'all-tests',
      }
    ],
  },
})
```

A Playwright Check Suite requires the following properties:

* `name` - a human friendly name for your check suite.
* `logicalId` - a reference for your check suite.

Other available properties like `frequency`, `alertChannels` or `locations` are inherited from the general Checkly configuration if not specified otherwise.

## Playwright references

Without limiting and selecting specific tests or Playwright projects, the Checkly infrastructure will run and deploy **all your existing Playwright tests** (similar to what `npx playwright test` runs) as monitors.

Specify which tests should become part of global end-to-end monitoring by defining these properties:

* `pwProjects`: select existing project by name from your Playwright configuration to create a Playwright Check Suite.

* `pwTags`: select tagged test that will be grouped into a Playwright Check Suite.

You can combine `pwTags` and `pwProjects` to generate your check suite, too.

For example:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={11, 20}
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Marketing Environment",
        logicalId: "environment-marketing-suite",
        // Run the `environment-marketing` Playwright project
        // in two locations every hour
        pwProjects: ["environment-marketing"],
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2"],
      },
      {
        name: "Critical production tests",
        logicalId: "critical-tests",
        // Run `@critical` tagged Playwright tests
        // in three locations every ten minutes
        pwTags: ["@checkly"],
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2", "af-south-1"],
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

## Monitoring customizations

A Playwright Check Suite inherits multiple properties from [the abstract `Check` class](/cli/constructs-reference/#check):

- `name`
- `activated`
- `muted`
- `locations`
- `tags`
- `frequency`
- `alertChannels`
- `privateLocations`
- `retryStrategy`
- `alertEscalationPolicy`

Check [the reference documentation](/constructs/project#param-checks-playwright-checks) for more information on these settings.

Additionally, Playwright Check Suites provide specific configuration for your Playwright monitoring.

* `installCommand:` Override the command to install dependencies, by default it'll use `npm install --dev`.

* `testCommand:` Override the command to test, by default it uses npx playwright test with the tags, projects, and config file options your check specifies.

* `groupName:` The group this check belongs to.

```typescript checkly.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  checks: {
    // specify your config file
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        /**
         * Run `@e2e` tagged tests across browsers
         * every 5 minute from 4 locations.
         */
        // Human readable name
        name: 'E2E test suite',
        // Reference id
        logicalId: 'e2e-test-suite',
        // Playwright project references defined in `playwright.config`
        pwProjects: ['chromium', 'firefox', 'webkit'],
        // Playwright tags defined in `spec` files
        pwTags: '@e2e',
        // Override default dependencies install command
        installCommand: 'npm install --dev',
        // Override the default test command
        testCommand: 'npx playwright test --grep@checkly --config=playwright.foo.config.ts',
        // Activate the check so that it runs on a schedule, true by default
        activated: true,
        // Mute the check so that it doesn't send alerts
        muted: false,
        // Add a check to a group
        groupName: 'production-group',
        // Specify a monitoring frequency
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_5M,
        // Define locations to monitor from
        locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1','eu-central-1', 'ap-south-1'],
      }
    ]
  },
}
```
