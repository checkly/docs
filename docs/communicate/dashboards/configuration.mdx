## Dashboard Privacy and Access Control

By default, Checkly dashboards are public and accessible to anyone with the URL. You can restrict access by enabling password protection or Checkly account authentication.

> **Plan Requirements**: Private dashboards are available on Team and Enterprise plans. Checkly account login is exclusive to Enterprise customers.

### Setting Up Password Protection

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Dashboard Settings">
Go to the dashboard you want to protect and access its settings
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Password Protection">
Toggle on password protection and click "Save" to apply changes
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Password">
Click the "Generate Password" button that appears after saving
</Step>

<Step title="Secure Your Password">
Copy the password from the modal - **this is the only time you'll see it in plaintext**
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
**Important**: We don't store passwords in plaintext. If lost, you'll need to generate a new password and update all users with the new credentials.
</Warning>

### Accessing Protected Dashboards

Protected dashboards work with both access methods:

**Password Authentication** (Team and Enterprise plans)
- Available on custom domains and default `https://[dashboardId].checkly-dashboards.com` URLs
- Use the generated password to access the dashboard

**Checkly Account Login** (Enterprise only)
- Available only on default `https://[dashboardId].checkly-dashboards.com` URLs
- Click "Login with Checkly" and sign in with your existing account
- Supports all authentication methods (Google, GitHub, username/password)


<Warning>
Remember that dashboards are public by default. Always review which checks and data you're exposing before sharing dashboard URLs with external audiences.
</Warning>
