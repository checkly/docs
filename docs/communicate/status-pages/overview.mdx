Status pages provide transparent communication about your service health and incidents to customers, users, and stakeholders. Checkly's status pages automatically reflect your monitoring results and create a professional interface for incident communication.

## What are Status Pages?

Status pages are public-facing websites that display real-time information about your services' health and operational status. They serve as the primary communication channel between your team and your users during both normal operations and incidents.

### Automatic Incident Management
Connect monitoring checks directly to services for automated incident handling:

<Card title="Automatic incident resolution" icon="check-circle">
**When Checks Recover**
- Incident automatically resolved

### Incident Backfilling
Add historical incidents to maintain accurate status page history:

<Steps>

Create incidents for past outages or maintenance windows
</Step>

<Step title="Custom Date Selection">
Set specific dates and times for historical incidents
</Step>

<Step title="Subscriber Management">
Choose whether to notify current subscribers about historical incidents

### Multi-Check Service Integration
Connect multiple monitoring checks to a single service:

```yaml
# Example: E-commerce Checkout Service
Checkout Service:
  Connected Checks:
    - Payment Processing API
    - Inventory Management API
    - Order Confirmation Email
    - Shopping Cart Functionality
  
  Incident Logic:
    - Any single check failure = "Partial Outage"
    - Multiple check failures = "Major Outage"
    - All checks failing = "Complete Outage"
```
