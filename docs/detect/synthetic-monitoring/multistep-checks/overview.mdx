## What are Multistep Checks?

Multistep checks are API-focused tests that perform multiple sequential HTTP requests within a single check. They're designed to test complete user workflows that span multiple API endpoints, ensuring that complex business processes work correctly from start to finish.

**Multistep checks are perfect for:**
- User authentication and authorization flows
- E-commerce checkout and payment processes
- Data processing and workflow pipelines
- Multi-step form submissions
- Complex business transaction testing
- API dependency chain validation

- Sequential API request execution
- Data passing between requests
- Complex authentication flows
- Workflow state validation
- Performance measurement across steps
</Accordion>

## How Multistep Checks Work

Multistep checks execute a series of API requests in sequence, with the ability to pass data between steps:

1. **Step Execution** - Runs each API request in defined order
2. **Data Flow** - Passes response data from one step to the next
3. **State Validation** - Verifies system state at each step
4. **Error Handling** - Manages failures and rollback scenarios
5. **Performance Tracking** - Measures timing across the entire workflow
6. **Result Aggregation** - Combines results from all steps

<Tip>
Multistep checks are powered by Playwright's API testing mode, providing excellent debugging capabilities and detailed request/response logging.

## Metrics

### Workflow Execution Details
- **Step-by-step timeline**: Complete execution trace with timing
- **Request/response logs**: Full HTTP transaction details for each step  
- **Variable tracking**: Values passed between workflow steps
- **Performance metrics**: Response times and execution duration
- **Error context**: Detailed error information and stack traces

### Business Process Insights
- **Workflow success rate**: Percentage of successful end-to-end executions
- **Step failure analysis**: Which steps fail most frequently
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Slowest steps in the workflow
- **Data flow validation**: Verification of data integrity across steps

### Operational Metrics
- **End-to-end timing**: Total workflow execution duration
- **Step-level performance**: Individual request response times
- **Resource utilization**: API rate limit usage and costs
- **Geographic performance**: Workflow speed across monitoring locations
