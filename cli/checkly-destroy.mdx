## What Gets Destroyed

The `destroy` command removes the all the resources managed by the specified project. These resources could include:

- **Checks** (API, Browser, Heartbeat, etc.)
- **Monitors** (URL, TCP, DNC, etc.)
- **Check Groups** and their configurations
- **Alert Channels** defined in your project
- **Maintenance Windows** created via CLI
- **Private Locations** (if managed by the project)

## Safety Considerations

By default, the command prompts for confirmation:

```bash Terminal
$ npx checkly destroy
