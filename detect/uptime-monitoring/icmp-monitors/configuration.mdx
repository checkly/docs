### Basic Setup

Configure your ICMP monitor by specifying the target host:

</Frame>


* **Hostname or IP address:** The server you want to monitor (e.g. `db.example.com` or `203.0.113.1`)
* **IP family:** Choose between IPv4 (default) or IPv6
* **Pings per run:** Number of ICMP Echo Request packets to send per check run (1-50, default: 10)

### Assertions

Validate latency metrics to ensure your infrastructure meets performance requirements:

[IMG]

You can create assertions based on:

* **Latency metrics:** Validate `min`, `max`, `avg`, or `stddev` latency values
* **JSON response:** Assert against the JSON response structure. This allows you to target specific fields using JSON path assertions.

  With JSON path assertions, you can:
  * $.latency.max → catch latency spikes
  * $.packetsReceived → detect dropped ping respondes
  * $.dnsResolutionTime → separate DNS issues from ICMP latency
  * $.pingResults[*].ttl → check TTL values

  Learn more about JSON path assertions: [JSON responses with JSON path](/detect/assertions/#json-responses-with-json-path).

### Packet Loss Limits

Define packet loss thresholds to determine when an ICMP monitor should be considered degraded or failed:

</Frame>

### Frequency

Set how often the monitor runs (every 10 seconds to 24 hours):

### Scheduling & Locations

  <img className="hidden dark:block" src="/images/dns-monitors/scheduling-dark.png" alt="ICMP monitor scheduling strategy and location selection interface" />
</Frame>

* **Strategy:** Choose between round-robin or parallel execution. Learn more about [scheduling strategies](/concepts/scheduling)
* **Locations:** Select one or more [public](/concepts/locations/#public-locations) locations to run the monitor from
* **Private locations**: ICMP monitors do not currently support private locations

### Additional Settings

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/communicate/maintenance-windows/overview)
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/communicate/alerts/retries)
* **Alerting:** Configure your [alert settings](/communicate/alerts/configuration), [alert channels](/communicate/alerts/channels), or set up [webhooks](/integrations/alerts/webhooks) for custom integrations
