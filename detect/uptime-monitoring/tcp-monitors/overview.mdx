## What are TCP Monitors?

Use TCP monitors to verify that your non-HTTP services are working as expected. TCP monitors work by establishing a connection to a host and port, then checking the speed and validity of the response.

For example, use these checks to verify that:

* Your mail server is online and responds to IMAPS requests quickly
* Your FTP server responds correctly to commands
* Your custom TCP-based service returns the expected response when sent a health check message

## How TCP Monitoring Works

TCP monitors perform connection-level checks:

1. **Connection Attempt** - Establishes a TCP connection to your service
2. **Port Verification** - Confirms the service is listening on the specified port
3. **Response Validation** - Optionally validates service responses based on your configured assertions

## TCP Monitor Results

Select a specific check run to review its results:

* **Summary:** Displays the monitor target (hostname and port), the monitor state (`success` for passed and degraded runs, or `error` for failed runs), the request status code and the total check run duration

* **Error details:** If the check failed, the error status code and message log will be shown

* **Request data:** If a payload was sent, it is shown alongside the response received from the server

* **Timing phases:** For each request, we capture the following timing metrics:
  * DNS: Time taken to resolve the hostname to an IP address (if a hostname was provided)
  * Connect: Time taken to establish the TCP connection (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
  * Data: Time taken to send the payload and receive the response data
