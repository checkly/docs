## With CI/CD Pipelines

Integrate heartbeat monitoring into your CI/CD pipelines to monitor deployment processes and post-deployment verification.

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Deploy and Monitor
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Deploy to production
        run: |
          # Your deployment steps
          echo "Deploying to production..."
          
      - name: Ping heartbeat after deployment
        run: |
          curl -m 5 --retry 3 ${{ secrets.HEARTBEAT_URL }}
        env:
          HEARTBEAT_URL: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYMENT_HEARTBEAT_URL }}
```

### GitLab CI Example

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy
  - verify

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - # Your deployment commands
  after_script:
    - curl -m 5 --retry 3 $DEPLOYMENT_HEARTBEAT_URL

verify:
  stage: verify
  script:
    - echo "Running post-deployment checks..."
    - # Your verification steps
  after_script:
    - curl -m 5 --retry 3 $VERIFICATION_HEARTBEAT_URL
```

### Jenkins Pipeline Example

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        HEARTBEAT_URL = 'https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-deployment-id'
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production...'
                // Your deployment steps
            }
            post {
                success {
                    sh 'curl -m 5 --retry 3 $HEARTBEAT_URL'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
