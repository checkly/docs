## Custom domain

<Note>
Custom domains are available on Communicate Starter and higher plans. [View pricing](https://checklyhq.com/pricing)
</Note>

You can host your Status Page under your own domain. To make this work, you need to do a few things:

<Steps>
<Step title="Add a valid custom domain to your Status Page">
![Custom domain configuration](/images/docs/images/status-pages/status-pages-custom-domain-1.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Create a CNAME record in your DNS that points to `custom-domain.checkly-status-page.com`">
Any DNS provider will have the option to easily add CNAME records. For example on Cloudflare this looks as follows.

If your provider is Cloudflare, you also need to disable the proxy on the CNAME, it should always be set to DNS only.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify you are the owner of the domain by adding a first `TXT` record to your DNS">
The owner verification TXT record details can be copied from the Status Page configuration section page after providing a custom domain and saving the page once.

<Note>
Your custom domain needs this verification in order for search engines to list your Status Page.

</Step>
<Step title="Add validation `TXT` record(s)">
The validation TXT record details can be copied from the Status Page configuration section after providing a custom domain and saving the page once.
