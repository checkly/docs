To set up a status page, select ‘New status page’ on the [Status page overview](https://app.checklyhq.com/status-pages).

1. Begin by selecting a name for your page.
2. Next, create at least one **card** for your page. Cards define the order and grouping of services on your page. One card can contain one or multiple **services** and will show the average uptime for all the services on the card.
3. If you haven’t already created a service for your page, you can do so from the `Services` dropdown. [Read more about services here](/communicate/status-pages/overview#services).
4. Select a subdomain for your page. By default status pages will use the domain `.checkly-status-pages.com` but you can also use your own domain. See [Custom domains](/communicate/status-pages/customization#custom-domains) for details on how to configure this.
5. When you are happy with your setup, click ‘Create status page.’ You will now see a preview of your page, and below the status page name, you have a link to the public page.

You can now share the link to your status page, and your users can subscribe to receive notifications when incidents are posted.

### Service Creation and Management

Create services that align with how your users think about your application:

```yaml
# Good service examples
Frontend Application:
  - Website loading and navigation
  - User interface responsiveness
  - Client-side functionality

API Services:
  - Core API endpoints
  - Authentication services
  - Data processing capabilities

Third-party Integrations:
  - Payment processors
  - Email delivery services
  - External data sources
```

<Tip>
Create services from your users' perspective, not your internal architecture. Users care about "Login" working, not whether your "Auth microservice cluster" is healthy.
