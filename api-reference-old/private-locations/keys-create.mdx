## Overview

The Create Private Location Key endpoint generates a new API key for a specific private location. Use these keys to authenticate monitoring agents and enable secure communication with Checkly.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Agent Deployment
- Key Rotation
- Security Updates
- New Agent Setup

<Warning>
Store API keys securely and never expose them in logs or public repositories. Keys provide full access to report check results for the private location.
</Warning>

<Note>
New API keys are active immediately. Use them to configure monitoring agents and ensure secure communication with Checkly services.
