## Overview

The Delete Private Location Key endpoint permanently removes an API key from a private location. This action immediately invalidates the key and stops authentication for any agents using it.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Key Rotation
- Security Incident Response
- Agent Decommissioning
- Access Revocation

<Warning>
Deleting API keys immediately invalidates them and will cause authentication failures for agents using the deleted key. Ensure agents are updated with new keys before deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
Coordinate key deletion with agent updates to avoid monitoring interruptions. Have replacement keys ready before removing old ones.
