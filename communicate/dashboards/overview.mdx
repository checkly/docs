Dashboards provide a detailed way to communicate the status of your checks and monitors to internal and external audiences. Create professional, branded status displays for customers, internal teams, or specific stakeholders.

Dashboards allow you to do the following:

- Show the status of all your checks, or a subset by filtering by `tag`.
- Show the availability and p95 / p99 response times over the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days.
- Communicate custom incident messages and maintenance messages.

You can create multiple, distinct dashboards based on your plan. Edit your dashboard by clicking on
the **Dashboards** button on the Checkly dashboard page.

| **Availability** | Percentage of successful runs | All check types |
| **P95** | 95th percentile response time | All check types except Heartbeat & ICMP |
