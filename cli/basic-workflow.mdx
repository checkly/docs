The Checkly CLI follows a simple workflow that enables you to test and deploy your monitoring checks. First run `npx checkly test` to test your checks locally, then run `npx checkly deploy` to deploy them to Checkly's infrastructure.

<Note>Before using the CLI, you'll need to [authenticate with your Checkly account](/cli/authentication).</Note>

## Step 1: Testing Checks Locally

The `test` command allows you to run your checks locally before deploying them to Checkly's infrastructure.

### Basic Testing

```bash Terminal
npx checkly test
```

This command will:
- Execute all checks defined in your project
- Run them in your local environment
- Display real-time results and logs
- Show pass/fail status for each check

### Testing Specific Checks

You can test individual checks or groups:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Test Specific Check
npx checkly test --check "My API Check"
```

```bash Test by Tags
npx checkly test --tags "api,production"
```

```bash Test by Group
npx checkly test --group "E-commerce Monitoring"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Testing Options

<CodeGroup>
```bash Test in Location
npx checkly test --location "us-east-1"
```

```bash Verbose Output
npx checkly test --verbose
```

```bash Generate Report
npx checkly test --reporter json
```
</CodeGroup>

### Local Testing Benefits

- **Fast Feedback**: Get immediate results without waiting for scheduled runs
- **Cost Effective**: No consumption of your Checkly plan's check runs
- **Development Friendly**: Perfect for debugging and development workflows
- **CI/CD Integration**: Can be used in automated testing pipelines

## Step 2: Deploying to Checkly

Once you've tested your checks locally and are satisfied with the results, deploy them to Checkly's global infrastructure.

### Basic Deployment

```bash Terminal
npx checkly deploy
```

This command will:
- Upload your check configurations to Checkly
- Create or update checks in your Checkly account
- Set up the monitoring schedule based on your configuration
- Deploy to all specified locations

### Deployment Options

<CodeGroup>
```bash Preview Changes
npx checkly deploy --preview
```

```bash Deploy to Environment
npx checkly deploy --environment production
```

```bash Force Deployment
npx checkly deploy --force
```

```bash Dry Run
npx checkly deploy --dry-run
```
</CodeGroup>

### Deployment Process

The deployment process includes:

1. **Validation**: CLI validates your check configurations
2. **Upload**: Check files and dependencies are uploaded to Checkly
3. **Creation/Update**: Checks are created or updated in your account
4. **Scheduling**: Monitoring schedules are configured
5. **Activation**: Checks become active and start monitoring

### Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, you can verify your checks are running:

<CodeGroup>
```bash List Checks
npx checkly list
```

```bash Check Status
npx checkly status
```

```bash View Results
npx checkly results
```
</CodeGroup>

## Monitoring Across Environments

<CodeGroup>
```bash Switch to Staging
npx checkly switch --environment staging
```

```bash Switch to Production
npx checkly switch --environment production
```

```bash View Current Environment
npx checkly env
```
</CodeGroup>

## Integrating with CI/CD

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
name: Deploy Monitoring
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npx checkly test
      - run: npx checkly deploy
        env:
          CHECKLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.CHECKLY_API_KEY }}
```



## Workflow Best Practices

1. **Start Local**: Always test changes locally first
2. **Incremental Testing**: Test individual checks during development
3. **Version Control**: Commit your check configurations to Git
4. **Review Changes**: Use `--preview` to review before deployment
5. **Monitor Results**: Check results after deployment

This comprehensive workflow ensures you can develop, test, and deploy monitoring checks with confidence, maintaining the reliability and performance of your applications.
