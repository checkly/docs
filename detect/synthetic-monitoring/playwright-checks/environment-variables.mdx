Checkly sets the following built-in environment variables on every Playwright Check Suite run. They provide information about the check execution environment, and allow you to distinguish between Checkly executions and local runs.

- **CHECKLY**: Set to `1` for all check runs executed by Checkly.
- **CHECKLY_RUN_SOURCE**: Indicates the manual or scheduled check run trigger. Use this variable to skip parts of your test suite in certain scenarios or adjust the check run configuration. Possible values include:
  - `CLI_DEPLOY`: Checks deployed using `npx checkly deploy` get their first run scheduled with this type.
  - `DEPLOYMENT`: The check was triggered as part of a [CI/CD deployment](/integrations/ci-cd/github/deployments).
  - `GROUP_RUN_ALL`: The check was triggered as part of a group edit by a user clicking the "Run all checks" button.
  - `SCHEDULE_NOW`: The check was triggered manually by a user clicking "Schedule now" in the webapp.
  - `SCHEDULER`: The check was run as part of its regular schedule.
  - `TEST_NO_RECORD`: The check triggered from the CLI with `npx checkly test`.
  - `TEST_RECORD`: The check triggered from the CLI with `npx checkly test --record` or `npx checkly pw-test`.
  - `TRIGGER_API`: The check was triggered via the API.
  - `TRIGGER_NO_RECORD`: The check triggered from the CLI with `npx checkly trigger`.
  - `TRIGGER_RECORD`: The check triggered from the CLI with `npx checkly trigger --record`.
- **CI**: Set to `1` for the following check runs:
  - CLI runs via `npx checkly test` or `npx checkly trigger`.
  - Check runs that are triggered by [deployments](/integrations/ci-cd/github/deployments).

The following variables are mostly for informational and debugging purposes and shouldn't be used to influence test behaviour.

- `ACCOUNT_ID`: The UUID of the Checkly account as found in the URL.
- `CHECK_NAME`: The name of the check.
- `CHECKLY_CHECK_ID`: The UUID of the check as found in the URL.
- `CHECKLY_REGION`: The region in which the check was executed.
