## Overview

The Create URL Check endpoint allows you to create new URL monitoring checks to verify website availability, response times, and basic HTTP health without complex scripting.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Website Uptime Monitoring
- Basic HTTP Health Checks
- Response Time Tracking
- Simple Availability Monitoring

<Note>
URL checks provide simple HTTP monitoring with basic response validation. For advanced API testing and complex assertions, use API checks instead.
