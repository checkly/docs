Monitoring as Code works by connecting Playwrighttest files with Checkly constructs to handle the end-to-endconfiguration of your Browser Check. 

## Browser Check Construct
The Browser Check construct is used to configure your monitoring settings, such as frequency, locations, and tags. Learn more about the [Browser Check Construct](/constructs/browser-check)

```ts browser-check.ts
import { BrowserCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'login.spec.js')
  }
})
```

## Test Script Structure

Checkly uses Playwright to power Browser Checks. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) is a robust, open-source framework for browser automation and end-to-end web application testing. It enables you to write atomic, reliable tests and easily control interactions within a web page. Browser checks execute automated test scripts in real browsers. 

```typescript login.spec.ts
// Use environment-specific URLs and credentials
const baseURL = process.env.BASE_URL || 'https://app.example.com'
const testUser = process.env.TEST_USER_EMAIL
const testPassword = process.env.TEST_USER_PASSWORD

test('Environment-aware test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto(`${baseURL}/login`)
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', testUser)
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', testPassword)
  // ... rest of test
})
```
