Alerting is organized around alert settings and alert channels, giving you complete control over when and how your team gets notified about monitoring issues.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ””">
Alert settings determine **when** and how many times alerts should be sent, while alert channels determine **how** (to which systems) alerts are delivered.
</Callout>

## Alert Settings

[Alert settings](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/alerting/) control the timing and frequency of your alerts. You can configure them at both the check and group level.

### Check-Level Alert Settings

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Run-Based Escalation">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "api-check" {
  name = "GET /api/books"
  type = "API"
  
  alert_settings {
    escalation_type = "RUN_BASED"
    
    run_based_escalation {
      failed_run_threshold = 1    # Alert after 1 failed run
    }
    
    ssl_certificates {
      enabled         = true      # Check SSL certificate expiry
      alert_threshold = 30        # Alert 30 days before expiry
    }
    
    reminders {
      amount   = 2               # Send 2 reminder alerts
      interval = 5               # 5 minutes between reminders
    }
    
    parallel_run_failure_threshold {
      enabled    = true          # For multi-location checks
      percentage = 50            # 50% of locations must fail
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Time-Based Escalation">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "api-check" {
  name = "GET /api/books"
  type = "API"
  
  alert_settings {
    escalation_type = "TIME_BASED"
    
    time_based_escalation {
      minutes_failing_threshold = 5  # Alert after 5 minutes of failure
    }
    
    ssl_certificates {
      enabled         = true
      alert_threshold = 30
    }
    
    reminders {
      amount   = 3
      interval = 10
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Group-Level Alert Settings

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Group Configuration">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check_group" "key-shop-flows" {
  name      = "Key Shop Flows"
  activated = true
  
  alert_settings {
    escalation_type = "RUN_BASED"
    
    run_based_escalation {
      failed_run_threshold = 1
    }
    
    ssl_certificates {
      enabled         = true
      alert_threshold = 30
    }
    
    reminders {
      amount   = 2
      interval = 5
    }
    
    parallel_run_failure_threshold {
      enabled    = true
      percentage = 50
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Configuration Options

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Escalation Types" icon="clock">
**Run-Based vs Time-Based**
- **Run-Based**: Alert after X failed runs
- **Time-Based**: Alert after X minutes of failure
- Choose based on your monitoring frequency
</Card>

<Card title="SSL Monitoring" icon="shield-check">
**Certificate Expiry**
- Monitor SSL certificate expiration
- Configurable alert threshold (days)
- Automatic certificate validation
</Card>

<Card title="Reminder System" icon="bell">
**Follow-up Alerts**

</Card>

<Card title="Multi-Location" icon="globe">
**Parallel Run Thresholds**
- Configure failure percentage for multi-location checks
- Reduce false positives from single location issues
- Supported values: 10-100% in 10% increments
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Alert Channels

[Alert channels](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/alerting/alert-channels/) define how alerts are delivered to your team. Checkly supports multiple notification methods.

### Email Alerts

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Basic Email">
```terraform
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "email_channel" {
  email {
    address = "team@example.com"
  }
  send_recovery = true     # Notify when checks recover
  send_failure  = true     # Notify when checks fail
  send_degraded = false    # Skip degraded performance alerts
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Slack Integration

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Slack Webhook">
```terraform
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "slack_channel" {
  slack {
    url     = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxx"
    channel = "#monitoring"
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure  = true
  send_degraded = true
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### PagerDuty Integration

<Tabs>
<Tab title="PagerDuty">
```terraform
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "pagerduty_channel" {
  pagerduty {
    account         = "your-account"
    service_key     = "your-service-key"
    service_name    = "checkly-monitoring"
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure  = true
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Webhook Integration

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Custom Webhook">
```terraform
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "webhook_channel" {
  webhook {
    name       = "Custom Webhook"
    url        = "https://api.example.com/webhooks/checkly"
    method     = "POST"
    template   = "custom"
    headers = {
      "Authorization" = "Bearer ${var.webhook_token}"
      "Content-Type"  = "application/json"
    }
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure  = true
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Alert Channel Subscriptions

Connect your checks and groups to alert channels through subscriptions:

### Individual Check Subscriptions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Single Check">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "api-check" {
  name = "GET /api/books"
  type = "API"
  
  # Check configuration...
  
  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.email_channel.id
    activated  = true
  }
  
  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.slack_channel.id
    activated  = true
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Group Subscriptions

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Check Group">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check_group" "api-group" {
  name      = "API Monitoring"
  activated = true
  
  # Group configuration...
  
  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.pagerduty_channel.id
    activated  = true
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Checks and groups need to be **explicitly** subscribed to alert channels - they will **not** be auto-subscribed.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Checks that are part of a group inherit the group's alert subscriptions. Handle alerting at the group level to avoid redundant subscriptions.
</Tip>

## Complete Example

Here's a comprehensive example combining alert settings, channels, and subscriptions:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Complete Setup">
```terraform
# Email alert channel
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "email_alerts" {
  email {
    address = "devops@example.com"
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure  = true
  send_degraded = false
}

# Slack alert channel
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "slack_alerts" {
  slack {
    url     = var.slack_webhook_url
    channel = "#alerts"
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure  = true
  send_degraded = true
}

# Check group with alert settings
resource "checkly_check_group" "critical_apis" {
  name      = "Critical API Endpoints"
  activated = true
  
  alert_settings {
    escalation_type = "RUN_BASED"
    
    run_based_escalation {
      failed_run_threshold = 1
    }
    
    ssl_certificates {
      enabled         = true
      alert_threshold = 14  # Alert 2 weeks before expiry
    }
    
    reminders {
      amount   = 3
      interval = 15
    }
    
    parallel_run_failure_threshold {
      enabled    = true
      percentage = 30  # Alert if 30% of locations fail
    }
  }
  
  # Subscribe group to both channels
  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.email_alerts.id
    activated  = true
  }
  
  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.slack_alerts.id
    activated  = true
  }
}

# Check that inherits group alert settings
resource "checkly_check" "user_api" {
  name     = "User API Health"
  type     = "API"
  group_id = checkly_check_group.critical_apis.id
  
  # Check configuration...
  # Inherits alert settings and subscriptions from group
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Alert Fatigue Prevention" icon="mute">
**Reduce Noise**
- Use appropriate failure thresholds
- Configure reminder limits
- Leverage parallel run thresholds for multi-location checks
</Card>

- Route critical alerts to PagerDuty/Slack
- Configure different channels for different severity levels
</Card>

<Card title="Group Organization" icon="layer-group">
**Efficient Management**
- Group related checks together
- Configure alerting at the group level
- Avoid duplicate individual subscriptions
</Card>
