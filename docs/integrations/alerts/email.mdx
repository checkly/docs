Email notifications provide a reliable and widely-supported way to receive alerts from your Checkly monitors. Set up email alerts for individuals or distribution lists with customizable content.

## Basic Email Configuration

Set up email alerts for individuals or distribution lists:

```yaml
Email Configuration:
  Recipients: 
    - engineering@company.com
    - ops-team@company.com
    - john.doe@company.com
  Alert Types: [Failure, Recovery]
  Subject Format: "[CHECKLY] {{ALERT_TITLE}}"
  Include Details: Response time, location, direct link
```

## Email Content

Email alerts include comprehensive check information:

```text
Subject: [CHECKLY] Check "Payment API" has failed

Alert Details:
- Check Name: Payment API Health Check

## Email Best Practices

### Distribution Lists vs Individual Addresses

- **Use distribution lists**: Instead of individual email addresses for better management
- **Role-based emails**: Use role-based addresses like ops-team@company.com rather than personal emails
- **Environment separation**: Set up different email lists for production, staging, and development

### Email Organization

- **Separate emails for severity levels**: Configure different email addresses for critical vs standard alerts
- **Email filters**: Set up email filters for automated processing and organization
- **Team-based routing**: Include relevant team members based on check ownership and service responsibility

### Subject Line Formatting

Customize subject lines for better email organization:

- Include environment indicators: `[CHECKLY-PROD]` vs `[CHECKLY-STAGING]`
- Add severity levels: `[CRITICAL]`, `[WARNING]`, `[INFO]`
- Use consistent formatting for automated filtering

### Managing Email Volume

- **Consolidate recovery notifications**: Consider whether recovery emails are needed for all alerts
- **Time-based filtering**: Reduce email volume during non-business hours for non-critical alerts
- **Escalation policies**: Only send email alerts after initial notification channels have been tried
