## QuickStart Guide

Here's how to get started with Playwright Check Suites.

<YoutubeEmbed id="eP9rSxVWt9Y" />

### Before you begin

What you need:

* A checkly account
* A repository using Playwright for end-to-end testing and a Playwright configuration file.

## Steps

### 1. Install the Checkly CLI


  ```bash terminal
  npm install --save-dev checkly
  ```

### 2. [Optional] If you're using TypeScript

  If you're using TypeScript, install the dev dependency [`jiti`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jiti). Jiti will enable the CLI to bundle your TypeScript config and test files correctly.

  ```bash terminal
  npm install --save-dev jiti
  ```



### 3. Use `pw-test` to test in Checkly

Run your existing Playwright test suite using `pw-test`.

`pw-test` accepts both Checkly and Playwright command line arguments using the following syntax:

`npx checkly pw-test [--checkly-flag] -- [--playwright-flag]`. Use `--` to separate Checkly and Playwright flags.

The CLI command will then return a link to the test session results, traces and more details:

```bash
$ npx checkly pw-test -- --project=chromium

Parsing your Playwright project... ✅

Validating project resources... ✅

Bundling project resources... ✅

Running 1 checks in eu-west-1.

playwright.config.ts
  ✔ Playwright Test: --project=chromium (16s)

```


### 4. Convert tests to monitoring checks with `pw-test --create-check`:

The `pw-test` command enables you to run your existing tests in the Checkly infrastructure. 
Use the `--create-check` flag to define the new check in your `checkly.config.ts` file. 
`--create-check` will create a `checkly.config.ts` file if it doesn't exist and will include the necessary definitions to run your Playwright tests as a synthetic check.

For example:

```bash
$ npx checkly pw-test --create-check -- --project=chromium
⚠ No Checkly config file found

ℹ Creating a default checkly config file.

Creating Checkly check from Playwright test... ✅
```

Review the resulting check configuration in your `checkly.config.ts` file and make sure to adjust locations and schedule as needed.

```typescript {title="checkly.config.ts"} highlight={8-18}
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

const config = defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'playwright-check-suites',
  projectName: 'my-repo-playwright-check-suites',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        logicalId: 'playwright-check-project-chromium', // Playwright Check Suite id
        name: 'Playwright Test: --project=chromium', // Playwright Check Suite name
        testCommand: 'npx playwright test --project=chromium', // Command to run your tests
        locations: [
          'eu-central-1', // monitoring locations
        ],
        frequency: 10, // monitoring frequency (every 10 minutes)
      },
    ],
    frequency: 10, // global default frequency
    locations: [
      'us-east-1', // global default location
    ],
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'us-east-1', // CLI test location used in `test` and `pw-test`
  },
})

export default config

```

### 5. Test your monitoring configuration

After creating your `checkly.config.ts` file, run the `checkly test` command to validate and test your Checkly monitoring infrastructure that now includes your new Playwright Check Suite.

```bash
$ npx checkly test

Parsing your project... ✅
Validating project resources... ✅
Bundling project resources... ✅

Running 1 checks in us-east-1.

playwright.config.ts
  ✔ Playwright Test: --project=chromium (22s)

1 passed, 1 total
```

<Info>
The difference between `checkly test` and `checkly pw-test` is that `test` uses `checkly.config.*` and takes all your defined monitors and runs them in the Checkly infrastructure. `pw-test` uses your `playwright.config.*` instead, which parses and runs your existing Playwright tests with the provided CLI configuration.
</Info>

### 6. Deploy your Playwright Check Suites

Once you are happy with the test results and ready to start monitoring your applications with your defined checks, deploy your Playwright Check Suite into global monitoring with `npx checkly deploy`.

```bash terminal
$ npx checkly deploy

> You are about to deploy your project "playwright-check-suites" to account "Checkly E2E Prod". Do you want to continue? … yes

Successfully deployed project "playwright-check-suites" to account "Checkly E2E Prod".
```

Once deployed, your checks will run on a schedule and results will appear in your [home dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com/).

## Next steps

Running your Playwright tests on a schedule is only the first step. To get alerted about production issues you need set up notifications and alerting.
