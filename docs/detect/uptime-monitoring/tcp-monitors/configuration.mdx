## Locations

TCP monitors can run from multiple global locations to ensure your services are accessible worldwide. See [monitoring locations](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/locations) for detailed configuration guidance:


## Metrics

TCP monitors track several timing metrics. Once your TCP monitor is running, you'll see:


- **Connection Time**: Time to establish the TCP connection
- **First Byte Time**: Time to receive first response byte
- **Total Response Time**: Complete request/response cycle
- **DNS Resolution Time**: Time to resolve the hostname
- **SSL Handshake Time**: Certificate validation time (if applicable)


## Alerting 

Configure alerts for various metric conditions. See [alerting configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/alerting) for comprehensive setup guidance:
- **Connection Failures**: When the service doesn't accept connections
- **Timeout Exceeded**: When responses take too long
- **Response Validation**: When expected responses don't match
- **Certificate Issues**: When SSL certificates are invalid or expiring
