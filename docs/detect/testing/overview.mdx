## Benefits of Testing with Checkly

- **Unified Testing and Monitoring**: Eliminate the traditional separation between pre-production testing and production monitoring with a single platform that spans the entire SDLC
- **Continuous Reliability**: Catch issues at any point in your delivery pipeline, not just during traditional testing phases
- **Code-First Approach**: Write tests and monitors in code, store them in repositories, and leverage version control for audits and automation
- **Early Risk Detection**: Identify business-critical issues before they impact users or revenue through continuous monitoring throughout the development process
- **Continuous Deployment Support**: Keep pace with modern rapid deployment cycles where traditional testing alone can't catch all defects
