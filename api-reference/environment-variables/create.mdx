## Overview

The Create Environment Variable endpoint allows you to add new environment variables to your Checkly account. These variables can be used across checks, scripts, and monitoring configurations to store sensitive data and reusable values.

**Common Use Cases**:
- API Key Storage
- Configuration Values
- Test Data Management
- Sensitive Information Storage

<Warning>
Store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens as locked variables to ensure they are encrypted and masked in logs.
</Warning>

<Note>
Environment variables are available across all checks in your account. Use locked variables for sensitive data to maintain security best practices.
