## Using Git
The CLI can attach git metadata like `branch`, `commit sha`, `owner` and more when executing the `test --record` and `deploy` commands. This way you can keep track of
your test sessions and deployed resources in the UI and cross-reference them with any updates to your code.

For example, in the screenshot below we ran a **test session** from our CI server after the project was deployed to our
Staging environment with the `npx checkly test --record` command.

After the test succeeds, we **deploy** this check so it runs as a monitor with `npx checkly deploy`.


## Environment variables

The CLI will attempt to auto-detect and parse git specific information from your local machine or CI environment, but you
can also set these data items specifically by using environment variables.

For example, if you want to specifically set the Environment you invoke:

```bash Terminal
CHECKLY_TEST_ENVIRONMENT=Production npx checkly test --record
```

Or, if you want to set repo URL you invoke:

```bash Terminal
CHECKLY_REPO_URL="https://my.git.solution/project/" npx checkly test --record
```
