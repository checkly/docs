<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before adding Playwright Check Suites to Groups, ensure you have:

- An initialized Checkly CLI project with Playwright Check Suites configured
- Basic understanding of [Check Groups](/constructs/check-group-v2) in Checkly

For additional setup information, see [Playwright Check Suites overview](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview).
</Accordion>

You can define a new Group, or associate a Playwright Check Suite to an existing Group.

## Why use Groups?

Grouping your Playwright Check Suites provides several benefits:

- **Shared configuration**: Set locations, frequency, retry strategies, and other settings once for all checks in the group
- **Better organization**: Group related checks together (e.g., by feature, environment, or service)
- **Unified alerting**: Configure alert channels and escalation policies at the group level
- **Easier management**: Activate, mute, or configure multiple checks simultaneously

## Steps

### 1. Create a group for your checks

Create a new file to create and configure your new group.

```typescript website-group.check.ts
import { CheckGroupV2, RetryStrategyBuilder } from 'checkly/constructs'

export const myGroup = new CheckGroupV2('production-group', {
  name: 'Production group',
  activated: true,
  muted: false,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['mac', 'group'],
  environmentVariables: [],
  apiCheckDefaults: {},
  concurrency: 100, // Max checks running concurrently when group is triggered
  runParallel: true, // Run checks simultaneously across all locations
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategyBuilder.linearStrategy({
    baseBackoffSeconds: 30, // Wait 30s, 60s, etc. between retries
    maxRetries: 2,
    sameRegion: false // Retry from different regions to detect regional issues
  }),
})
```

### 2. Associate the Group to the check

When specifying your Playwright Check Suite, you can reference the new or existing group, using its name:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={13}
export default defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'checkly-website',
  projectName: 'checkly-website',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'Critical Tests',
        logicalId: 'critical-tests',
        pwTags:'critical',
        frequency: 10,
        locations: ['us-east-1',],
        groupName: 'Production group', // use the name of the group you created
      },
    ],
  },
})

export default config
```

### 3. Deploy to apply the changes

```bash
npx checkly deploy --preview # confirm what will be deployed
npx checkly deploy           # deploy
```

You can now see your Playwright Check Suite assigned to your Group.

## Multiple Check Suites in one Group

To ensure that multiple Playwright Check Suites inherit the same Group's configuration (locations, retry strategy, alert channels, etc.) while maintaining their individual test selection and frequency settings, you can reference the Group name in each suite's configuration. Example:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={12,19,26}
export default defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'checkly-website',
  projectName: 'checkly-website',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'Critical User Flows',
        logicalId: 'critical-flows',
        pwTags: 'critical',
        frequency: 5,
        groupName: 'Production group', // Same group
      },
      {
        name: 'Authentication Tests',
        logicalId: 'auth-tests',
        pwTags: 'auth',
        frequency: 10,
        groupName: 'Production group', // Same group
      },
      {
        name: 'Checkout Flow',
        logicalId: 'checkout-flow',
        pwTags: 'checkout',
        frequency: 5,
        groupName: 'Production group', // Same group
      },
    ],
  },
})
```
