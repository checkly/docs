## What are Multistep Checks?

Multistep checks are API-focused tests that perform multiple sequential HTTP requests within a single check. They're designed to test complete user workflows that span multiple API endpoints, ensuring that complex business processes work correctly from start to finish.

**Multistep checks are perfect for:**
- User authentication and authorization flows
- E-commerce checkout and payment processes
- Data processing and workflow pipelines
- Multi-step form submissions
- Complex business transaction testing
- API dependency chain validation


## How Multistep Checks Work

Multistep checks execute a series of API requests in sequence, with the ability to pass data between steps:

1. **Step Execution** - Runs each API request in defined order
2. **Data Flow** - Passes response data from one step to the next
3. **State Validation** - Verifies system state at each step
4. **Error Handling** - Manages failures and rollback scenarios
5. **Performance Tracking** - Measures timing across the entire workflow
6. **Result Aggregation** - Combines results from all steps

<Tip>
Multistep checks are powered by Playwright's API testing mode, providing excellent debugging capabilities and detailed request/response logging.

## Key Capabilities

<Accordion title="Sequential API Request Execution">
Execute multiple API calls in a predefined order, ensuring each step completes successfully before proceeding to the next.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Data Passing Between Requests">
Extract data from API responses and use it in subsequent requests, enabling realistic workflow testing with dynamic values.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Complex Authentication Flows">
Handle multi-step authentication processes like OAuth flows, token refresh sequences, and session-based authentication chains.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Workflow State Validation">
Verify that each step in your business process maintains proper state and data consistency throughout the entire workflow.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Measurement Across Steps">
Monitor response times and performance metrics for individual steps and the complete workflow to identify bottlenecks.
</Accordion>

## Timeouts
As with Browser checks, Checkly runs Multistep checks for a maximum of 240s. Scripts exceeding this will timeout. For more information on how to work with the timeout limits for Multistep and Browser checks, see [Timeouts](/docs/browser-checks/timeouts).

## Built-in Runtime Variables

The Multistep Check [runtime](/docs/platform/runtimes/overview) exposes a set of environment variables (e.g. `process.env.CHECK_NAME`) that indicate what check, check type etc. you are running.
