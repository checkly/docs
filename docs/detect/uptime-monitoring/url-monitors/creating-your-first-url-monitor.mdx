sidebarTitle: 'Creating Your First Monitor'
---

This guide walks you through creating your first URL monitor to check the availability and performance of your websites, APIs, or any HTTP-based service.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Create from UI">

Each URL monitor is defined by its request configuration, which includes the target URL and how its availability and performance should be validated.

To validate the response, you can configure:

* **Response time limits:** Define latency thresholds for degraded or failed states.
* **Assertions:** Validate the returned response status code (e.g. expect `200`).

<Accordion title="Additional settings for URL monitors include:">

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts.
* **Tags:** Tags organize monitors across dashboards and maintenance windows.
* **Scheduling:** Set how frequently the monitor runs and choose execution strategies.  
* **Locations:** Select optimal monitoring locations for global coverage. 
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. 
* **Alerting:** Configure comprehensive alerting and notification rules.

With the [Checkly CLI](/cli/overview), you can define URL monitors in TypeScript or JavaScript and manage them as code. See [CLI configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/cli-configuration) for comprehensive examples and advanced patterns.
