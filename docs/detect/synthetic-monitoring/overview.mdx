## What is Synthetic Monitoring?

Synthetic monitoring goes beyond simple uptime checks by proactively validating your applications by simulating real user interactions and API workflows. Checkly's Synthetic Monitoring ensures your critical systems work correctly from both technical and user experience perspectives. It validates complete business processes, user experiences, and system integrations before your users encounter issues.


## Types of Synthetic Monitoring Checks

Checkly provides three powerful check types to comprehensively monitor your applications:

<Card title="API Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/api-checks/overview">
Monitor individual API endpoints with detailed request/response validation. 


</Card>


<Card title="Multistep Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/multistep-checks/overview">
Test complex API workflows with sequential requests and data flow validation.


</Card>
<Card title="Browser Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview">
Simulate real user interactions with automated browser testing using Playwright.

## Getting Started Guide

<Steps>
<Step title="Identify Critical Workflows">
Map your most important user journeys and API workflows:
- User registration and authentication
- Core feature functionality
- Payment and transaction processing
- Data retrieval and submission
</Step>

<Step title="Choose Check Types">
Select appropriate monitoring approaches:
- **API checks** for backend service validation
- **Browser checks** for user experience monitoring  
- **Multistep checks** for complex workflow testing
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Monitoring">
Set up comprehensive monitoring coverage:
- Global monitoring locations
- Appropriate frequency for each check type
- Performance thresholds and alerting
- Authentication and environment variables
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy and Monitor">
Launch your synthetic monitoring and track results:
- Monitor initial execution and performance
- Adjust thresholds based on baseline data
- Set up team alerting and notifications
- Review and optimize over time
</Step>
</Steps>
