## Built-in variables available in Playwright Check Suites

Checkly sets the following environment variables on every Playwright Check Suite run:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CHECKLY` | Set to `1` for all check runs executed by Checkly.<br/>Useful to distinguish Checkly runs from local runs. |
| `CHECKLY_RUN_SOURCE` | Indicates how the check was triggered.<br/>Useful to customize the nature of your test depending on how it is run.<br/>See [CHECKLY_RUN_SOURCE values](#checkly-run-source-values) below. |
| `CI` | Set to `1` for CLI runs (`npx checkly test` or `npx checkly trigger`) and [deployment](/integrations/ci-cd/github/deployments)-triggered checks. |
| `ACCOUNT_ID` | The UUID of the Checkly account. |
| `CHECK_NAME` | The name of the check. |
| `CHECKLY_CHECK_ID` | The UUID of the check. |
| `CHECKLY_REGION` | The region where the check was executed. |

### `CHECKLY_RUN_SOURCE` values

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `CLI_DEPLOY` | Used for the first run of Checks deployed using `npx checkly deploy`. |
| `DEPLOYMENT` | Used for Check runs triggered as part of a [CI/CD deployment](/integrations/ci-cd/github/deployments). |
| `GROUP_RUN_ALL` | Used for Check runs triggered from a Group's edit screen, by clicking the "Run all checks" button. |
| `SCHEDULE_NOW` | Used for Check runs triggered manually by clicking "Schedule now" in the webapp. |
| `SCHEDULER` | Used for Check runs triggered as part of their regular schedule. |
| `TEST_NO_RECORD` | Used for Check runs triggered by the `npx checkly test` CLI command. |
| `TEST_RECORD` | Used for Check runs triggered by the `npx checkly test --record` or `npx checkly pw-test` CLI commands. |
| `TRIGGER_API` | Used for Check runs triggered by the API. |
| `TRIGGER_NO_RECORD` | Used for Check runs triggered by the `npx checkly trigger` CLI command. |
| `TRIGGER_RECORD` | Used for Check runs triggered by the `npx checkly trigger --record` CLI command. |

## Use built-in variables

Common ways to use Checkly's built-in environment variables:

### Skip tests in production monitoring

Skip certain tests when running in Checkly that you only want to run locally during development:

```typescript highlight={5}
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('slow integration test', async ({ page }) => {
  // Skip this test in Checkly - too slow for monitoring
  if (process.env.CHECKLY === '1') {
    test.skip();
  }

  // Test that takes several minutes or hits rate limits
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000');
  // ... rest of your test
});
```

### Adjust behavior based on trigger type

Set different behavior for scheduled runs versus manual triggers:

```typescript highlight={4}
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('API health check', async ({ request }) => {
  const isScheduledRun = process.env.CHECKLY_RUN_SOURCE === 'SCHEDULER';

  // Use shorter timeout for scheduled runs
  const timeout = isScheduledRun ? 5000 : 30000;

  const response = await request.get('https://api.example.com/health', {
    timeout
  });

  // ... assertions
});
```

### Configure Playwright based on environment

Adjust your Playwright configuration for different environments in `playwright.config.ts`:

```typescript playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  // Use 2 workers on Checkly, 1 on CI and undefined elsewhere
  workers: process.env.CHECKLY === '1' ? 2 : process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,

  use: {
    // Always trace in Checkly to compare successful and failed runs, only on retry elsewhere
    trace: process.env.CHECKLY === '1' ? 'on' : 'on-first-retry',
  },

  // Retry failed tests in Checkly and CI, but not locally
  retries: (process.env.CHECKLY === '1' || process.env.CI) ? 2 : 0,
});
```

### Access region information

Use region information for debugging or region-specific behavior:

```typescript highlight={10}
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

test('geo-specific content test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // Log region for debugging
  console.log(`Running in region: ${process.env.CHECKLY_REGION}`);

  // Region-specific assertions
  if (process.env.CHECKLY_REGION?.startsWith('eu-')) {
    // Expect EU-specific content, like a cookie banner
  }
});
```
