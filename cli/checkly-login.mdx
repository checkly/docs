The `checkly login` command authenticates with Checkly by signing up for a new account or logging in to your existing account. This command opens a browser window for secure OAuth authentication.

## Usage

Initiate the login process and authenticate with your Checkly account.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly login
```

## Extended Usage

The login process is interactive and will:

1. **Open your default browser** to the Checkly authentication page
2. **Prompt for account selection** if you have multiple accounts
3. **Store authentication tokens** locally for future CLI usage
4. **Display confirmation** with your account information

```bash Terminal    
npx checkly login
✓ Opening browser for authentication...
✓ Successfully authenticated as user@company.com
✓ Active account: My Company (550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000)
```

## Authentication Flow

### New Users
If you don't have a Checkly account:
1. Click "Sign up" on the authentication page
2. Complete account registration
3. Return to the CLI - you'll be automatically logged in

### Existing Users
If you already have an account:
1. Enter your credentials on the authentication page
2. Complete any two-factor authentication if enabled
3. Return to the CLI - authentication will complete automatically

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli-reference/global-options):

- [`--verbose`](/cli-reference/global-options#verbose-or-v) - Show detailed authentication process

## Authentication Storage

After successful login, the CLI stores authentication tokens locally in:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/checkly-cli/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/checkly-cli/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\checkly-cli\`

These tokens are encrypted and used for subsequent CLI operations without requiring re-authentication.

## Related Commands

- [`checkly whoami`](/cli-reference/checkly-whoami) - Display current account information
- [`checkly switch`](/cli-reference/checkly-switch) - Switch between multiple accounts

## Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't open automatically
If the authentication browser window doesn't open:
1. Copy the displayed URL from the terminal
2. Manually open it in your preferred browser
3. Complete authentication and return to the CLI

### Multiple accounts
If you have access to multiple Checkly accounts, you'll be prompted to select which account to use as the active account for CLI operations.
