title: 'List Private Locations'
openapi: 'GET /v1/private-locations'
description: 'Retrieve all private locations in your account'

## Overview

Private locations allow you to run checks from your own infrastructure, providing monitoring from behind firewalls, in specific geographic regions, or from custom network environments. This endpoint returns all private locations configured in your account.

<Info>
Private locations require running the Checkly Agent in your infrastructure to execute checks from your own network.

- Checks will fail or be skipped
- Requires investigation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DEGRADED">
The private location has issues but is partially functional:

## Filtering and Monitoring

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Query Parameters">
Filter private locations by various criteria:

- `limit` (integer): Number of results per page (max 100)
- `page` (integer): Page number (1-based)
- `status` (string): Filter by status (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, DEGRADED, MAINTENANCE)
- `region` (string): Filter by region
- `tag` (string): Filter by tag
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Health Monitoring">
Monitor private location health:

```javascript
// Check if private location is healthy
function isLocationHealthy(location) {
  const lastHeartbeat = new Date(location.lastHeartbeat);
  const fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000);
  
  return location.status === 'ACTIVE' && lastHeartbeat > fiveMinutesAgo;
}

// Get stale private locations
function getStaleLocations(locations) {
  return locations.filter(location => !isLocationHealthy(location));
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Agent Version Tracking">
Track agent versions across your private locations:

```python
def check_agent_versions(locations):
    versions = {}
    for location in locations:
        version = location['agentVersion']
        if version not in versions:
            versions[version] = []
        versions[version].append(location['name'])
    
    return versions

# Example usage
version_report = check_agent_versions(data['data'])
for version, location_names in version_report.items():
    print(f"Agent v{version}: {', '.join(location_names)}")
```
</Accordion>

## Private Location Management

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent Installation">
To set up a private location:

1. **Create the Private Location**: Use the API or web interface
2. **Generate API Keys**: Get authentication credentials
3. **Install the Agent**: Deploy the Checkly Agent in your infrastructure
4. **Configure Connectivity**: Ensure network access to Checkly services
5. **Verify Status**: Check that the location shows as ACTIVE
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Requirements">
Private locations require:
- **Outbound HTTPS (443)**: To Checkly's API endpoints
- **WebSocket Connection**: For real-time communication
- **DNS Resolution**: Access to public DNS or custom resolvers
- **Resource Requirements**: Sufficient CPU and memory for check execution
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Maintenance and Updates">
Regular maintenance tasks:
- **Agent Updates**: Keep agents updated to latest versions
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor heartbeat and status
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitor check execution times
- **Log Review**: Check agent logs for errors or warnings
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
Private locations require the Checkly Agent to be installed and running in your infrastructure. The agent handles check execution and communicates results back to Checkly's platform.
