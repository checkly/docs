## What are Playwright Checks Suites?

Playwright Check Suites enable you to run entire Playwright end-to-end test suites, Playwright projects or tagged tests as pre-production tests and global production monitors, without rewriting your tests and configuration.

Unlike [Browser Checks](detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview), Playwright Check Suites are not limited to a single test spec and our preinstalled runtime dependencies. Playwright Check Suites enable you to run Playwright projects complete with all of your required dependencies, private packages, storage, data, and more, and enable you to detect issues with your applications or services even in the most complex scenarios.

**Playwright Check Suites are the native way to run Playwright in production** and support the full Playwright API and ecosystem, meaning you can use your existing tests and `playwright.config.ts` files as is.

**Playwright Check Suites are perfect for:**
- Converting existing E2E tests into monitoring
- Testing complex user workflows across multiple browsers
- Monitoring critical business processes
- Validating application functionality after deployments


## How Playwright Checks Suites Work

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Test Discovery">
Playwright Check Suites analyze your Playwright configuration and test files to understand your existing test structure.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Selective Monitoring">
Use tags and projects to define monitoring scope, choosing which tests become production monitors.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Global Deployment">
Deploy your selected tests to run from multiple worldwide locations for comprehensive coverage.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Continuous Monitoring">
Execute tests on schedules with performance tracking and detailed reporting.
</Step>

<Step title="5. Alert Integration">
Receive notifications when tests fail or performance degrades, keeping your team informed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Runtime Limits**: During Beta, Playwright Checks can run up to 20 minutes per execution. This limit can be adjusted based on feedback.
</Info>

## Test Selection

Control which tests become monitoring checks using:

- **Projects**: Choose browser configurations from your Playwright config
- **Tags**: Select tests marked with specific tags (e.g., `@critical`, `@smoke`)
- **Combinations**: Mix tags and projects for precise test selection

```typescript checkly.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Marketing Environment",
        logicalId: "environment-marketing-suite",
        // Select the tests defined in
        // the `environment-marketing` Playwright project
        pwProjects: ["environment-marketing"],
      },
      {
        name: "@critical tests",
        logicalId: "critical tests",
        // Select tests tagged as `@critical`
        pwTags: ["@critical"],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

<Info>
The Playwright Check Suite runner will use the `pwProjects` and `pwTags` values to configure [the native Playwright Test CLI run](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli). `pwProjects` reflects the `--project` and `pwTags` the `--grep` CLI options.

## Monitoring Configuration

Customize monitoring behavior with:

- **Frequency**: From every minute to custom schedules
- **Locations**: Choose from global monitoring regions
- **Alerting**: Configure team notifications and escalation
- **Groups**: Organize related checks for management
- **Dependencies**: Support for private packages and custom registries
