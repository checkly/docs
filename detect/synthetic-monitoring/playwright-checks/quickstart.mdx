<PlaywrightCheckSuiteBetaNote />

Use your existing Playwright tests as live, scheduled monitoring checks. No rewrites required. Get from zero to deployed checks in 5 minutes.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before you begin, you need:

- A Checkly account
- A repository using Playwright for E2E tests and a Playwright configuration file
</Accordion>

## Steps

### 1. Install the Checkly CLI

```bash
npm install --save-dev checkly
```

### 2. [Optional] If you're using TypeScript

If you're using TypeScript, install the dev dependencies [`jiti`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jiti) and [`typescript`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript). These help the CLI bundle your typescript config and test files correctly.

```bash
npm install --save-dev jiti typescript
```

### 3. Test with `pw-test`

Run your Playwright test suite using `pw-test`.

`pw-test` accepts both Checkly and Playwright command line arguments using the following syntax:

`npx checkly pw-test --checkly-flag -- --playwright-flag`. Use `--` to separate Checkly and Playwright flags.

The CLI command will then return a link to results, traces and more details:

```bash
> npx checkly pw-test -- --project=chromium

playwright.config.ts
  ✔ Playwright Test: --project=chromium (16s)

```

### 4. Convert tests to checks

Using `pw-test` with the `--create-check` flag will create a `checkly.config.ts` file if it doesn't exist, and will add the new check. Afterwards, you can tweak the monitoring configuration for your check.

For example:

```bash
> npx checkly pw-test --create-check -- --project=chromium
⚠ No Checkly config file found

ℹ Creating a default checkly config file.

Creating Checkly check from Playwright test... ✅
```

Review the resulting check configuration in your `checkly.config.ts` file and make sure to tweak locations and schedule as needed.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

const config = defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'my-repo-name',
  projectName: 'my-repo-name',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        logicalId: 'playwright-check-project-chromium', // tweak ID
        name: 'Playwright Test: --project=chromium', // tweak name
        testCommand: 'npx playwright test --project=chromium', // what we'll run as part of your check suite
        locations: [
          'eu-central-1', // add or change locations
        ],
        frequency: 10, // a custom per-check frequency
      },
    ],
    frequency: 10, // a global default frequency
    locations: [
      'us-east-1', // a global default location
    ],
  },
  cli: {
    runLocation: 'us-east-1', // where test and pw-test will run
  },
})

export default config
```

### 5. Deploy your Playwright Check Suites

Once you are ready to start monitoring your applications with these checks, deploy your Playwright Check Suite into global monitoring with `npx checkly deploy`.

```bash
npx checkly deploy

> You are about to deploy your project "playwright-check-suites" to account "Checkly E2E Prod". Do you want to continue? … yes

Successfully deployed project "playwright-check-suite" to account "Checkly E2E Prod".
```

Once deployed, your checks will run on a schedule and results will appear in your [home dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com/).

### 6. Set up Alerts

Configure alert channels and alert groups to get notified when checks fail. You can receive alerts via email, Slack, webhooks, and more.

To set up alerts:

1. Go to the Checkly dashboard.
2. Navigate to [**Alert Channels**](https://app.checklyhq.com/accounts/alerts/settings) to create a new channel.
3. Assign channels to your project or individual checks.

Learn more in the [alerting guide](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/alerts/).
