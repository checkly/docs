## URL and Domain Configuration

### Default Dashboard URLs
Every dashboard starts with a unique, randomly generated URL:

```text
# Default URL format
https://{random-id}.checkly-dashboards.com

# Example
https://a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.checkly-dashboards.com
```


```text
# Custom subdomain format
https://{your-subdomain}.checkly-dashboards.com

# Examples
https://acme-status.checkly-dashboards.com
https://api-health.checkly-dashboards.com
https://prod-monitoring.checkly-dashboards.com
```

<Note>
Custom subdomains must be unique across all Checkly users. Choose something specific to your organization to avoid conflicts.
