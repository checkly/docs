Use the [Checkly CLI](/cli/) to turn your Playwright tests into globally distributed monitors. Checkly uses your existing `package.json` dependencies and Playwright configuration.

## Using JavaScript/Node.js dependencies

Checkly installs dependencies from your `package.json` and lock files. It works with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@faker-js/faker": "^9.7.0"
  }
}
```

<Note>
Checkly uses npm by default.
</Note>

Checkly detects your package manager from your lock file:

| Available lock file | Package manager |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| `package-lock.json` | npm             |
| `pnpm-lock.json`    | pnpm            |
| `yarn.lock`         | yarn            |

<Warning>
**For pnpm users:** If you define the same dependency in both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`, use a custom `installCommand` in your `checkly.config.ts` to install all dependencies: `pnpm install`
</Warning>

## Using private dependencies

Your private packages work without changes. Checkly installs them using the credentials you provide.

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@your-org/private-package": "^2.3.0"
  }
}
```


To install private packages, Checkly authenticates with your package registry. You need to:

1. Add authentication configuration to your `.npmrc` file
2. Include the `.npmrc` file in your Checkly configuration file
3. Store authentication tokens as [environment variables](/platform/variables) in Checkly

### Configuration files for private packages

All package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) use `.npmrc` files to authenticate with private registries.

<Note>
Store authentication tokens as Checkly [environment variables](/platform/variables). Reference them in your `.npmrc` file using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax.
</Note>

#### Using private npm packages

```txt
# Using an environment variable (recommended)
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}

# Hard-coded token (not recommended)
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_abc...
```

#### Using JFrog Artifactory

```txt
# Using an environment variable (recommended)
registry=https://yourcompany.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:_authToken=${ARTIFACTORY_TOKEN}

# Hard-coded token (not recommended)
registry=https://yourcompany.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/npm/npm-local/:_authToken=abc...
```

#### Using GitHub Packages

```txt
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
@your-org:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

### Using yarn or pnpm with private packages

**yarn** and **pnpm** also use `.npmrc` for authentication (same format as npm examples above).

### Include authentication files

Add your `.npmrc` file to the `checks.include` property in your `checkly.config.ts`.

When you run `npx checkly test` or `npx checkly deploy`, the CLI bundles and uploads these files. This makes them available when Checkly runs `installCommand` to install your dependencies.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={5}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    // Include .npmrc for authentication with private registries
    // Works with npm, yarn, and pnpm
    include: ['.npmrc'],
    playwrightChecks: [
      // ...
    ]
  }
})
```

## Troubleshooting

### Package not found

If you see errors like `404 Not Found` or `Package '@your-org/package' not found`:

- Verify your `.npmrc` file is included in `checks.include`
- Check that the registry URL is correct
- Ensure your package name matches exactly (including scope)

### Authentication failed

If you see `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors:

- Verify the environment secret is set in Checkly (check [environment variables](/platform/variables) for details)
- Ensure the variable name in your config file matches exactly (e.g., `${NPM_TOKEN}`)
- Check that your token has the necessary permissions to access the package

### Wrong package manager detected

If Checkly uses the wrong package manager:

- Verify the correct lock file is present (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.json`)
- Remove any conflicting lock files
- If needed, override with a custom `installCommand` in your [Playwright Check Suite configuration](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/configuration)

### Installation timeout

If package installation exceeds time limits:

- Check for large dependencies that can be optimized
- Consider using a custom `installCommand` to install only required packages
