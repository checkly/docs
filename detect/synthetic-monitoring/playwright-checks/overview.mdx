## What are Playwright Check Suites?

**Playwright Check Suites turn your Playwright end-to-end tests into production monitors.** Run entire test suites, specific projects, or tagged tests globally without modifying your existing code or configuration.

<Warning>
**Known limitations**: Each check run has a maximum execution time of 30 minutes.
</Warning>

**Use Playwright Check Suites to:**
- Turn E2E tests into global synthetic monitors
- Monitor complex user workflows across browsers and regions
- Detect issues in critical business processes
- Verify functionality after deployments

## How Playwright Check Suites Work

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Select tests">
Choose which tests to turn into monitors using Playwright projects or tags from your existing configuration.
</Step>
<Step title="Choose frequency and locations">
Specify the locations to run the check from, and set its frequency

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy globally">
Run selected tests on schedules from global locations with performance tracking and detailed reporting.
</Step>

<Step title="Get alerted">
Receive notifications when tests fail or performance degrades.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Test Selection

Control which tests run as monitors using:

- **Projects**: Select browser and project configurations from your Playwright config with `pwProjects`
- **Tags**: Choose tests marked with specific tags (e.g., `@critical`, `@smoke`) with `pwTags`
- **Combinations**: Mix tags and projects for precise control
- **testCommand**: Use `npx playwright test ...` to select the tests you want to create a monitor for, using playwright flags like `--grep-invert` or `--projects`

Configure test selection in your `checkly.config.ts` file:

```typescript checkly.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Marketing Environment",
        logicalId: "environment-marketing-suite",
        // Select the tests defined in
        // the `environment-marketing` Playwright project
        pwProjects: ["environment-marketing"],
      },
      {
        name: "@critical tests",
        logicalId: "critical-tests",
        // Select tests tagged as `@critical`
        pwTags: ["@critical"],
      },
            {
        name: "customTestCommand",
        logicalId: "custom-testCommand-critical-no-smoke",
        // Select tests not tagged as `@smoke` and tagged as @critical
        testCommand: "npx playwright test --grep-invert @smoke --grep @critical"
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

## Monitoring Configuration

Customize how your checks run:

- **Frequency**: Schedule runs at regular intervals
- **Locations**: Deploy to multiple global regions
- **Alerting**: Set up notifications and escalation
- **Dependencies**: Use private packages and custom registries (see [custom dependencies](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/custom-dependencies))
