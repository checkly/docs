## What are API Checks?

API checks are automated HTTP requests that validate API endpoint functionality by checking status codes, response content, headers, and performance metrics. They simulate real API usage patterns and help catch issues before they impact your users. You can create API checks in the UI, via the [API Check Construct](/constructs/api-check) or by importing your existing Swagger/OpenAPI spec.

**API checks are perfect for:**
- REST API endpoint monitoring
- GraphQL API validation
- Authentication system testing
- Third-party API dependency monitoring
- Payment and transaction APIs

- HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Request/response validation
- JSON schema validation
- Authentication handling
- Performance measurement
- Global monitoring locations

## How API Checks Work

API checks perform comprehensive endpoint validation:

1. **HTTP Request** - Sends configured requests with headers, body, and authentication
2. **Response Analysis** - Captures status codes, headers, body content, and timing
3. **Validation** - Runs assertions against response data and performance metrics
4. **Performance Tracking** - Measures response times and identifies trends
5. **Alert Generation** - Notifies teams when endpoints fail or degrade

<Tip>
API checks are ideal for testing both internal services and external API dependencies your application relies on.
