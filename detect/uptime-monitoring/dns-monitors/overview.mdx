## What are DNS Monitors?

DNS monitors check that your DNS records resolve as expected. They help you catch misconfigurations, expired records, or propagation issues before they impact your users.  

**Typical use cases include:**  
- Detecting if your domain stops resolving to its IP address to prevent downtime
- Verifying that records resolve correctly when queried against a specific nameserver (e.g. 208.67.222.222 for OpenDNS) to catch resolver-specific issues
- Monitoring DNS response times to detect performance degradation or resolver latency
- Spotting slow or inconsistent DNS resolution across different regions

## How do DNS monitors work?

DNS monitors perform lookups to verify your DNS configuration:

1. **Query initiation**: Checkly runs a DNS lookup from your configured location(s)

2. **Resolver selection**: The query is sent to a DNS resolver:
   - **Default**: The query is sent to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS). If that resolver returns an error (SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, etc.), Checkly automatically retries with 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS), then with an internal AWS resolver.
   - **Custom resolver**: You can specify your own nameserver (and port) to test resolver-specific behavior. In this mode, the query is sent only to your resolver, no failover is applied.

3. **DNS chain resolution**: The resolver queries the authoritative nameserver and retrieves the requested record type

4. **Response validation**: The response is validated against your configured assertions

For example, querying the A record for `checklyhq.com` returns:

```
NOERROR 0ms
;; opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16122
;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;checklyhq.com.	IN	 A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.127
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.76
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.10
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.85
```

The query response appears on the results page as both raw output and parsed JSON. Use it as a reference to define [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#assertions) for expected values.

## Supported DNS record types

DNS monitors support the following DNS record types:

- **A**: IPv4 address records
- **AAAA**: IPv6 address records
- **CNAME**: Canonical name (alias) records
- **MX**: Mail exchange server records
- **NS**: Nameserver records
- **SOA**: Start of authority records
- **TXT**: Text records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC, etc.)

## Limitations

- **Private locations**: DNS monitors do not currently support private locations. You can only run DNS monitors from Checkly's global public locations.

## DNS Monitor Results

Select a specific check run to inspect its results:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/dns_monitor_results_page.png" alt="DNS monitor results page" />
</Frame>

* **Summary:** Shows key request and response details:
   * Target domain
   * Monitor state (success for passed or degraded runs, error for failures), including the DNS status code
   * Total check duration
   * Nameserver used: Defaults to 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) with automatic failover to 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare) and an internal AWS resolver on errors. You can also configure a custom nameserver and port
   * Protocol used (UDP or TCP)

* **Error details:** If a run fails, the DNS status code and error message are shown to help diagnose the issue

* **Response payload:** Displays the raw DNS response and the [parsed JSON output](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#json-response-schemas) for assertions and debugging

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="Users still hitting old IPs after DNS changes">
**Symptom**: DNS updated but users still reach old infrastructure

**Root causes**:
- **TTL caching**: Old records remain cached until TTL expires
- **Resolver differences**: Different DNS resolvers update at different times
- **CDN caching**: Content delivery networks may cache DNS responses independently

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Verify new IP is resolving**: Use assertion `$.Answer[0].data` to check that the correct IP is returned
2. **Monitor TTL timing**: Add assertion `$.Answer[0].TTL` to track when records should fully propagate
3. **Test multiple resolvers**: Configure monitors with different nameservers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, custom) to verify all resolvers have updated
4. **Check multiple regions**: Run monitors from multiple Checkly locations to catch regional propagation issues

**Prevention tip**: Lower TTL values 24-48 hours before planned DNS changes to speed up propagation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong number of DNS records returned">
**Symptom**: Expected multiple records (A, MX, NS, etc.) but getting fewer or more than expected

**Root causes**:
- **Dynamic infrastructure**: Auto-scaling events add/remove instances
- **Health checks**: Load balancers automatically remove unhealthy instances from DNS
- **Configuration drift**: Manual changes not reflected in monitoring

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Set exact count assertion**: Use `$.Answer.length` equals `X` for static infrastructure
2. **Use range assertions**: For auto-scaled systems, use `$.Answer.length` is greater than `2` and less than `10`
3. **Monitor specific records**: Use `$.Answer[?(@.data == '203.0.113.1')]` to verify critical IPs are present
4. **Alert on unexpected changes**: Set alerts to notify when record count deviates from baseline

**Example for MX records**: Ensure backup mail servers are configured with `$.Answer.length` equals `2` or greater.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DNS works locally but fails for some users">
**Symptom**: DNS resolves from your network but fails for certain users or regions

**Root causes**:
- **Resolver behavior differences**: Public resolvers (Google, Cloudflare, ISP) may have different caching policies or DNSSEC validation
- **Geographic DNS routing**: GeoDNS returns different results based on query location
- **Corporate/ISP filtering**: Organizations may block or redirect certain domains
- **DNSSEC validation failures**: Some resolvers enforce DNSSEC while others don't

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Test multiple resolvers**: Create separate monitors with different nameservers:
   - Google DNS: `8.8.8.8:53`
   - Cloudflare DNS: `1.1.1.1:53`
   - OpenDNS: `208.67.222.222:53`
   - User-reported resolver: Custom IP
2. **Monitor from multiple locations**: Run monitors from regions where users report issues
3. **Validate DNSSEC**: Use `dig +dnssec` locally to check for DNSSEC issues
4. **Check for hijacking**: Compare responses across resolvers to detect DNS hijacking or filtering

**Pro tip**: If users report issues with specific ISPs, test against those ISP's DNS resolvers directly.
