Playwright enables us to control multiple browser tabs, albeit in different ways. 

## Opening tabs directly

If we are looking to open brand new tabs with which to interact, the setup is rather straightforward.

```ts multitab-open.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('open multiple tabs', async ({ browser }) => {
  const context = await browser.newContext()

  const pageOne = await context.newPage()
  const pageTwo = await context.newPage()

  await pageOne.goto('https://www.checklyhq.com/')
  await pageTwo.goto('https://playwright.dev/')

  await pageOne.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot-tab-one.png' })
  await pageTwo.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot-tab-two.png' })

  await browser.close()
})

```


## Handling links that open a new tab

Controlling tabs that are opened after a click on an element on the page can be trickier. Let's explore this through an example: 

- Navigating to `https://checklyhq.com/docs`.
- Opening a new tab by clicking the link to the Checkly YouTube channel which opens in a new tab.

By allowing us to wait for the creation of a child tab with `page.waitForEvent`, Playwright enables us to "catch" it following a click on an element with `target="_blank"`, and then seamlessly interact with any of the currently open tabs. 

```ts multitab-flows.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('open multiple tabs', async ({ browser }) => {
  const context = await browser.newContext()
  const page = await context.newPage()

  await page.goto('https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/')

  const [newPage] = await Promise.all([
    context.waitForEvent('page'),
    await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Checkly on Youtube' }).click()
  ])

  await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot-tab-old.png' })
  await newPage.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot-tab-new.png' })

  await browser.close()
})

```
