### Basic Setup

Monitor public URLs by specifying the endpoint you want to track.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-entry.png" alt="URL monitor setup interface showing IP family selection, URL input field, Skip SSL, Follow redirects and Should fail option" />
</Frame>

* **Request method:** Always GET
* **URL:** The HTTP(S) URL to monitor (e.g. https://api.example.com)
* **IP family:** Choose between IPv4 (default) or IPv6
* **Follow redirects:** Automatically follow 30x redirects
* **Skip SSL:** Skip SSL certificate validation
* **This request should fail:** Treat HTTP error codes (4xx and 5xx) as passed. Please note that successful responses still pass. Only failed assertions will cause the check to fail

### Assertions

Use assertions to validate the status code of your URL request. When one or more assertions fail, an alert is triggered:

</Frame>

For more details, see our documentation on [Assertions](/detect/assertions).

### Response Time Limits

Set performance thresholds to ensure your application meets speed requirements:

</Frame>

* **Degraded After**: Time threshold (in milliseconds) after which the check is marked as degraded but not failed. Use for performance warnings without triggering failure alerts

* **Failed After**: Time threshold after which the check fails completely. Use for hard performance limits where slow responses should trigger alerts

### Frequency

Set how often the monitor runs (every 10 seconds to 24 hours):

</Frame>

### Scheduling Strategy

Choose when and how your checks run across multiple locations:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-scheduling.png" alt="URL monitor scheduling strategy interface showing round robin vs fixed schedule options" />
</Frame>

* **Round Robin** (Default): Checks run on one of the selected locations each time it is scheduled

* **Parallel**: Checks run from all selected locations simultaneously. Higher consumption but provides immediate global visibility for critical services

Learn more in our documentation on [Scheduling strategies](/concepts/scheduling/#scheduling-strategies).

### Locations

Select one or more [public](/concepts/locations#public-locations) or [private](/platform/private-locations/overview) locations to run the monitor from.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-locations.png" alt="URL monitor locations selection interface showing global monitoring locations" />
</Frame>

We recommend to chose at least 2-3 locations that best represent your user base for optimal monitoring coverage.

### Retries

Select the retry strategy to determine how failed checks are retried:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-retries.png" alt="URL monitor retries interface showing retry strategy options" />
</Frame>

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **None** | No retries - fail immediately on first failure for fastest detection |
| **Single** | Retry once after failure with configurable delay |
| **Fixed** | Retry a specific number of times with consistent intervals between attempts |
| **Linear** | Increase retry delay linearly with each attempt to avoid overwhelming failed services |
| **Exponential** | Double the retry delay with each attempt for maximum protection against service overload |

### Alert Settings

Configure notifications for your team:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/url-monitor-alert.png" alt="URL monitor alert settings interface showing notification configuration options" />
</Frame>

#### Notification Scope

Choose how alerts are configured for this monitor:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Use global account notification settings** | Inherit notification preferences from Global Notification Settings |
| **Use specific notification settings** | Configure alert behavior exclusively for this check |

#### Escalation Rules

Control when alerts are triggered:

**Primary Trigger** (Choose one):
- **When a check has failed X time(s)**: Sends alert after specified consecutive failures
- **When a check is failing for more than Y minutes**: Sends alert if failure duration exceeds threshold

**Additional Condition** (Optional):
- **When a check is failing in Z% of locations**: Only applies to checks running in parallel across multiple locations

#### Reminders

Configure follow-up alerts after initial failure notification:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Maximum reminders** | Number of follow-up alerts (0 = no reminders) |
| **Reminder interval** | Time between reminders (only if maximum reminders > 0) |

#### Alert Channels

Define where notifications are sent when checks fail or recover. Additional channels can be configured in global notification settings.

**Alert Types** (per channel):
- ✅ **Success/Recovery**: Check has recovered from failure
- ⚠ **Degraded**: Check is degraded but not failed
- ❌ **Failure**: Check has failed

<Note>
**Global Alert Settings**: By default, monitors inherit your account's notification preferences. Select "Use specific notification settings" to customize alerts for individual monitors.
