Dashboards provide a detailed way to communicate the status and performance of your monitoring checks and services to internal and external audiences. Create professional, branded status displays for customers, internal teams, or specific stakeholders.

## Metrics To Display
Comprehensive performance data for transparency and accountability:

| Metric | Time Period | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Availability** | 24h, 7d, 30d | Percentage of successful checks | SLA reporting |
| **P95 Response Time** | 24h, 7d, 30d | 95th percentile response time | Performance baseline |
| **P99 Response Time** | 24h, 7d, 30d | 99th percentile response time | Performance outliers |
| **Uptime Statistics** | Historical | Long-term reliability data | Trust building |
