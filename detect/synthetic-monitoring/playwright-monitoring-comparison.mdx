[MultiStep Checks](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/multistep-checks/overview), [Browser Checks](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview), and [Playwright Check Suites](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) use Playwright for synthetic monitoring. The different check types differ in terms of capabilities, flexibility, and use cases.

Checkly's strengths are that you can log in to the Checkly web application, write Playwright code in the built-in editor, and start monitoring your APIs and sites. **MultiStep and Browser checks are the perfect tools to get you off the ground quickly.** Don't worry about where to store the monitoring code, how to configure advanced settings, or when to update dependencies. Checkly takes care of all of this.

However, when your monitoring setup needs to match scaling and growing project requirements, you'll quickly find yourself looking for ways to version-control your checks with [the Monitoring as Code approach \(MaC\)](/concepts/monitoring-as-code).

All Playwright-based checks can be created, updated and configured as code. But, when should you use which?

## When to use MultiStep Checks

[MultiStep Checks](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/multistep-checks/overview) enable you to monitor complex API workflows with sequential requests using the familiar Playwright API. The check run is based on a single `spec.ts` file, limited to making HTTP requests (there's no browser available) and **the max check run duration is capped at { checkDurations.multiStep }**.

## When to use Browser Checks

[Browser Checks](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview) let you monitor end-to-end user flows and realistic interactions with automated browser testing using Playwright. The check run is based on a single `spec.ts` file, supports the headless Chromium/Chrome browser and **the max check run duration is capped at { checkDurations.browser }**.

## When to use Playwright Check Suites

MultiStep and Browser Checks are single units based on a single `spec.ts` file.

[Playwright Check Suites](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview), on the other hand, let you take your entire existing Playwright test suite, and turn it into globally distributed monitoring. Check Suites support multiple spec files, advanced global configuration, multiple Playwright projects, tags for selective monitoring, storage state, custom dependencies, and more.

<Tip>
Playwright Check Suites are the native way to run your Playwright project in production.
