Effective alerting is crucial for maintaining service reliability. This guide covers how to configure alerting for all types of uptime monitors to ensure your team responds quickly to issues.

## Alert Conditions

Different monitor types trigger alerts based on specific failure conditions:

### URL Monitor Alerts
- **HTTP errors** (4xx, 5xx status codes)
- **Response time threshold exceeded**
- **Content validation failed**
- **SSL certificate issues**
- **Network connectivity problems**

### TCP Monitor Alerts
- **Connection failures**
- **Timeout exceeded**
- **Response validation failed**
- **SSL certificate issues**

### Heartbeat Monitor Alerts
- **Missing pings** (no ping received within expected timeframe)
- **Grace period exceeded**

## Alert Channels

Configure multiple notification methods to ensure alerts reach the right people:

Team notifications in Slack channels with rich formatting

### Advanced Integrations
- **PagerDuty** - On-call management and escalation
- **Microsoft Teams** - Team collaboration and notifications
- **Custom Webhooks** - Integration with ITSM, ChatOps, and monitoring tools

## Alert Configuration Best Practices

### Channel Selection by Severity

**Low Priority Alerts:**
- Email notifications
- Slack channel for non-critical services
- No immediate action required

**Medium Priority Alerts:**
- Email + Slack notifications
- Team channel notifications
- Action required during business hours

**High Priority Alerts:**
- All channels (Email + Slack + SMS)
- PagerDuty escalation
- Immediate action required

### Alert Timing and Frequency

**Immediate Alerts:**
```yaml
Trigger: First failure detected
Channels: All configured channels
Use for: Critical production services
```

**Delayed Alerts:**
```yaml
Trigger: After 2-3 consecutive failures
Channels: Email, Slack
Use for: Less critical services to reduce noise
```

**Escalation Alerts:**
```yaml
Trigger: Issue unresolved after X minutes
Channels: SMS, PagerDuty
Use for: Critical services requiring guaranteed response
```

## Configuring Email Alerts

Email alerts provide detailed information about monitor failures:

### Email Content
- **Monitor name and type**
- **Failure reason and error details**
- **Affected locations**
- **Failure duration**
- **Direct links to monitor dashboard**

### Email Configuration
```yaml
Recipients: team@company.com, oncall@company.com
Subject: "[ALERT] {monitor_name} is DOWN"
Format: HTML with detailed error information
Frequency: Immediate, then digest for ongoing issues
```

## Slack Integration

Slack alerts provide real-time team notifications with interactive elements:

### Slack Alert Features
- **Rich formatting** with monitor status and metrics
- **Quick actions** like acknowledge or view details
- **Thread updates** for ongoing incident tracking
- **Channel routing** based on monitor tags or criticality

### Setup Example
```yaml
Channel: #monitoring-alerts
Message Format:
  - Monitor name and status
  - Error details and location
  - Response time and availability metrics
  - Quick action buttons
```

## Webhook Configuration

Webhooks enable custom integrations with your existing tools:

### Common Webhook Uses
- **ITSM Integration** - Automatically create service tickets
- **ChatOps** - Trigger automated response playbooks
- **Custom Dashboards** - Update internal status pages
- **Metrics Collection** - Feed data into analytics platforms

### Webhook Payload Example
```json
{
  "monitor": {
    "name": "Production API",
    "type": "url_monitor",
    "id": "monitor_123"
  },
  "alert": {
    "type": "monitor_failure",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "message": "HTTP 500 Internal Server Error"
  },
  "check_result": {
    "status_code": 500,
    "response_time": 5000,
    "location": "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## Alert Management

### Alert Acknowledgment
- **Manual Acknowledgment** - Team members can acknowledge alerts
- **Auto-Acknowledgment** - Automatic acknowledgment when issues resolve
- **Escalation Rules** - Escalate unacknowledged alerts after time periods

### Alert Suppression
- **Maintenance Windows** - Suppress alerts during planned maintenance
- **Alert Grouping** - Combine related alerts to reduce noise
- **Rate Limiting** - Prevent alert flooding during widespread outages

### Alert History
- **Timeline View** - See all alerts and resolutions over time
- **Alert Analytics** - Track mean time to resolution and alert frequency
- **Team Performance** - Monitor response times and acknowledgment rates

## Advanced Alerting Strategies

### Multi-Location Alerting

**Regional Failures:**
```yaml
Condition: 1+ locations in same region failing
Action: Email notification to regional team
Escalation: If multiple regions affected
```

**Global Outages:**
```yaml
Condition: 3+ locations across regions failing
Action: Immediate SMS + PagerDuty
Escalation: Executive notification after 15 minutes
```

### Conditional Alerting

**Business Hours vs. After Hours:**
```yaml
Business Hours (9 AM - 6 PM):
  - Email + Slack notifications
  - 30-minute escalation to manager

After Hours:
  - Immediate SMS to on-call engineer
  - 15-minute escalation to backup
```

**Service Criticality:**
```yaml
Critical Services:
  - Immediate multi-channel alerts
  - No delay or batching

Non-Critical Services:
  - Email alerts only
  - 15-minute delay for transient issues
```

### Performance Degradation Alerts

Monitor performance trends and alert on degradation:

```yaml
Warning Threshold: Response time > 2x baseline
Critical Threshold: Response time > 5x baseline
Duration: Sustained for 5+ minutes
Action: Graduated alerts based on severity
```

## Alert Testing and Validation

### Regular Testing
- **Test all alert channels monthly**
- **Verify escalation rules work correctly**
- **Confirm contact information is current**
- **Validate webhook integrations**

### Alert Simulation
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-webhook-url.com/alerts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": true, "monitor": "test-monitor"}'
```

## Troubleshooting Common Alert Issues

### Missing Alerts

**Symptoms:**
- Service is down but no alerts received
- Alerts delayed or inconsistent

**Solutions:**
1. Check alert channel configuration
2. Verify contact information is current
3. Test alert delivery manually
4. Review alert suppression settings

### Alert Fatigue

**Symptoms:**
- Too many false positive alerts
- Team ignoring or delaying responses
- Alert acknowledgment rates dropping

**Solutions:**
1. Adjust alert thresholds and timing
2. Implement alert grouping and rate limiting
3. Use maintenance windows during deployments
4. Regular review and tuning of alert rules

### Integration Failures

**Symptoms:**
- Slack/webhook alerts not delivering
- PagerDuty escalations not working
- Email alerts in spam folders

**Solutions:**
1. Verify integration credentials and permissions
2. Check webhook endpoint availability
3. Review email filtering and whitelist settings
4. Test integrations regularly
