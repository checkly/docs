The Checkly API enables you to manage your monitoring infrastructure, retrieve account information, and export analytics using HTTP requests.

<Note>
  For creating and updating resources, we recommend using the [Checkly CLI](/cli/overview) or another [Monitoring as Code](/learn/monitoring/monitoring-as-code/) option. Managing resources using the Checkly API is possible, but Monitoring as Code generally provides a better experience for this.

## Authentication

The Checkly Public API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can get a API Key in your [user settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys).

Your API key is like a password: keep it secure!

Authentication to the API is performed using the Bearer auth method in the Authorization header and using the Account ID.

For example, set the `Authorization` and `X-Checkly-Account` headers when using cURL:

```bash Bash icon="square-terminal"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [apiKey]" -H "X-Checkly-Account: [accountId]"
```

## Rate Limits

The Checkly Public API uses rate limits to help manage the sheer volume of requests we receive. The rate limit is characterized by allowing a maximum number of requests within a time interval.

For most of our routes, that limit is **600 requests every 60 seconds**.

However, we also have **routes with custom rate limits**. If the endpoint you are using has a custom rate limit, you will find that information in the documentation of that route.
