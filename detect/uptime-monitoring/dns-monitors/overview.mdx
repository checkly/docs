DNS monitors are currently available in the UI only. MaC support (CLI, Terraform, Pulumi) will be released shortly. Keep an eye on our [changelog](https://feedback.checklyhq.com/changelog) for updates.

## What are DNS Monitors?

DNS monitors check that your DNS records resolve as expected. They help you catch misconfigurations, expired records, or propagation issues before they impact your users.  

**Typical use cases include:**  
- Detecting if your domain stops resolving to its IP address to prevent downtime
- Verifying that records resolve correctly when queried against a specific nameserver (e.g. 8.8.8.8 or dns.google) to catch resolver-specific issues
- Monitoring DNS response times to detect performance degradation or resolver latency
- Spotting slow or inconsistent DNS resolution across different regions

## How do DNS monitors work?

To verify your DNS configuration, DNS monitors run lookups for the requested record type:

* When you specify a domain, Checkly runs a DNS lookup from the configured location(s)

* The query is sent to a DNS resolver (by default a public DNS server, or a custom one you define)

* The resolver continues through the DNS chain and retrieves the requested record type from the authoritative server

For example, querying the A record for `checklyhq.com` returns:

```
NOERROR 0ms
;; opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16122
;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;checklyhq.com.	IN	 A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.127
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.76
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.10
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.85
```

The query response appears on the results page as both raw output and parsed JSON. Use it as a reference to define [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#assertions) for expected values.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="Users Still Hitting Old IPs After DNS Changes">
**Symptom**: DNS updated but users still reach old infrastructure

**Causes**:
- TTL caching keeps old records alive
- Regional resolver differences
- Propagation delays

**Solutions**:
- Use [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#assertions) `$.response.answers[0].resolvedValue.value` to verify correct IP
- Monitor TTL with `$.response.answers[0].ttl` to track propagation timing
- Monitor from multiple Checkly locations
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Wrong Number of A Records Returned">
**Symptom**: Expected multiple A records but getting fewer than expected

**Causes**:
- Auto-scaling events changed record count
- Health checks removed unhealthy instances

**Solutions**:
- Use JSON path [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#assertions) `$.response.answers.length` for expected count
- Set range assertions for auto-scaling (e.g., 2-8 records)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="DNS Works Locally But Fails for Some Users">
**Symptom**: DNS resolves from your network but fails for certain users

**Causes**:
- Different public resolvers have different behaviors
- Corporate/ISP DNS filtering
- Resolver-specific caching issues

**Solutions**:
- Configure monitors with different DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
- Monitor from multiple geographic locations
- Test against specific resolvers users report issues with
