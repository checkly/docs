## Playwright feature troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Webserver doesn't start">
**Issue:** Tests fail because the `webServer` defined in `playwright.config.ts` doesn't start.

**Solution:**

Include your server files in the Checkly configuration using [`checks.include`](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/custom-dependencies#include-authentication-files):

```typescript checkly.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    include: ['server/**/*', 'config/**/*'],
    playwrightChecks: [
      // ...
    ]
  }
})
```

Alternatively, skip `webServer` on Checkly and point to your deployed URL:

```typescript playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.CHECKLY
      ? 'https://your-site.com'
      : 'http://localhost:3000',
  },
  ...(process.env.CHECKLY ? {} : {
    webServer: {
      command: 'npm run dev',
      url: 'http://localhost:3000',
      reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    },
  }),
})
```

<Accordion title="No tests found">
**Issue:** Deployed check runs no tests.

**Solution:**

Verify your configuration matches your Playwright setup:

1. Check that `pwProjects` and `pwTags` match your Playwright config exactly
2. Verify `playwrightConfigPath` points to the correct file
3. Test locally with `npx checkly test` to confirm which tests run

```typescript checkly.config.ts
checks: {
  playwrightConfigPath: './e2e/playwright.config.ts',
  playwrightChecks: [
    {
      name: 'My tests',
      logicalId: 'my-tests',
      pwTags: ['@smoke'], // Must match tags in your test files
    }
  ],
}
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Headed mode is not supported">
**Issue:** Tests configured with `headless: false` still run in headless mode.

Checkly runs all tests in headless mode and ignores the `headless: false` option.

**Solution:**

Use the `CHECKLY` environment variable to enable headed mode for local development only:

```typescript playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    headless: process.env.CHECKLY ? true : false,
  },
})
```
