Multistep checks are a powerful tool for monitoring complex API workflows. However, they can sometimes be tricky to troubleshoot. Here are some common issues and solutions:

## Authentication and Authorization
**Issue: Authentication failures or token expiration**

**Solutions**:
1. Verify credentials are current and valid
2. Implement token refresh logic for long workflows
3. Check API permissions for all required endpoints
4. Use environment variables for sensitive credentials

## Data Flow Problems
**Issue: Variables not passing correctly between steps**

**Solutions**:
1. Verify variable assignment syntax and scope
2. Add logging to track variable values
3. Check JSON parsing and data extraction logic
4. Validate API response formats match expectations

## Timing and Performance Issues
**Issue: Workflows timing out or running slowly**

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize API performance and database queries
2. Increase timeout values for complex operations
3. Implement parallel processing where possible
4. Add monitoring for long-running operations

## Error Handling and Recovery
**Issue: Workflows failing without proper cleanup**

**Solutions**:
1. Implement try-catch blocks with proper error handling
2. Add cleanup logic in finally blocks
3. Design idempotent operations for safe retries
4. Create rollback procedures for failed transactions
