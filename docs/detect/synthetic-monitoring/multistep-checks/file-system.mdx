You might want to use (binary) files in your Multistep checks. For example, you might want to upload a file to an API endpoint using a binary body. Or, you might want to validate some aspect of a file that is available for download on your
app.

## Testing uploads using HTTP POST requests

To test any binary uploads, you need to provide a file object. Currently, Checkly does not have a dedicated storage layer 
where you could upload that file, so you need to host it yourself at a (publicly) accessible location like an AWS S3 bucket, 
Dropbox or any other file hosting service.

Having done that, you can "upload" files using a simple HTTP POST request with a (binary) body using Playwright's built-in `request` object.

    const fileUrl  = 'https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tests/xhtml/testfiles/resources/pdf/dummy.pdf'
    return request.get(fileUrl)
  })

  await test.step('Upload file', async () => {
    const response = await request.post('https://filebin.net/pp9on3zvwv7zq6lm/dummy.pdf', {
      data: await fileBuffer.body(),

## Using the file system

Sometimes, you do want to explicitly save a file to disk. This is what you need to know.

Checkly creates a sandboxed directory for each check run. During the run you can use this directory to save or upload
artifacts. This directory is destroyed after a check is finished.

```ts
import path from 'path'
import fs from 'fs'
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('Save file in directory', async ({ page }) => {
  const image = await page.goto('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
  const imagePath = path.join('example.jpg')
  const buffer = await image.body()
  fs.writeFileSync(imagePath, buffer)
  const readFileFromDisk = fs.readFileSync(imagePath)
})
```
        </Tab>
<Tab title="Javascript">
```js save-file.spec.js
```js
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')
const { test } = require('@playwright/test')

test('Save file in directory', async ({ page }) => {
  const image = await page.goto('https://picsum.photos/200/300')
  const imagePath = path.join('example.jpg')
  const buffer = await image.body()
  fs.writeFileSync(imagePath, buffer)
  const readFileFromDisk = fs.readFileSync(imagePath)
})
```

Due to this sandbox, certain Node.js variables are adapted to our platform and have values we set for them. The behaviour
is slightly different when creating a browser check in the Web UI or using the Checkly CLI.

When creating a browser check in the Web UI, the variables are:

* `__dirname` will have the value of `/`
* `__filename` will have the value of `/script.js`

When creating a browser check using the Checkly CLI the variables are:

* `__dirname` will have the value of `/`
* `__filename` will have the value of the actual file in your code base, relative to the project root.
