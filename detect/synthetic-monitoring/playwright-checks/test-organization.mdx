Playwright Check Suites enable you to reuse your existing Playwright end-to-end tests for global synthetic monitoring.

</Frame>

Run your entire Playwright end-to-end test suite, pick specific tests or group multiple tests together to run them as global synthetic monitoring and get alerted when your Playwright-based monitors fail.

## How does an ideal Playwright Check Suite look like?

While a Playwright Check Suite can reflect and run your entire existing end-to-end test suite, **we recommend splitting your Playwright test suite into multiple Playwright Check Suites to fulfill your monitoring requirements**.

Playwright tests are run to validate a pre-production environment and prepare a production release. Full end-to-end test executions going way beyond fifteen minutes are common for this use case. And while running all the tests in preparation makes sense for testing, it is not ideal for monitoring.

**The longer your Playwright Check Suite runs, the longer you have to wait until you will receive an alert in case of a failure.** Your Playwright Check Suites should execute and fail quickly to guarantee a short Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).

    alt="Playwright Check Suites should be a subset of the entire Playwright end-to-end test suite."
  />
</Frame>

Split your Playwright tests into focus areas or groups of urgency to ensure the best monitoring frequency and alerting mechanisms.

<Tip>
What test duration is acceptable depends on your application and how quickly you want to be alerted in case of an issue. If your service level agreements (SLAs) require a fast reaction time, we recommend to keep your Playwright Check Suites as short as possible.

Remember: 99.9% uptime allows for 1m 26s downtime a day. To guarantee a high-level of uptime, your Playwright Check Suites should run significantly faster than that.
</Tip>


## How to include Playwright tests in your Playwright Check Suite

The quickest way to reuse your existing Playwright end-to-end tests as Playwright Check Suites is to specify your Playwright config path and a single Playwright Check Suite in your `checkly.config.ts`.

```typescript highlight={3-11}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [
      // Playwright Check Suite without
      // additional configuration or test selection
      {
        name: "Multiple Browser Suite",
        logicalId: "browser-compat-e2e-suite",
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

Each Playwright Check Suite requires a `name` and `logicalId`.

Without providing additional Playwright configuration (`pwProjects` or `pwTags`), the Playwright Check Suite will run all tests defined in the `playwright.config.ts`. It will include the tests that would also be run by `npx playwright test`.

Without providing additional Checkly configuration (`frequency` or `locations`), the Playwright Check Suite will run **every 10 minutes** in **the three default locations** (North Carolina, Tokyo, London).

<Tip>
While it's possible to run **all** your Playwright tests as long as your suite runs in under 15 minutes, we recommend to group your tests into multiple Playwright Check Suites with different monitoring configuration.

This approach leads to faster Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), overall transparency and more granular monitoring information.
</Tip>

## How to Organize your tests in Playwright Check Suites

Use the `pwProjects` and `pwTags` properties to group and organize your Playwright Check Suites.

### Group your Tests using Playwright Projects (recommended)

Select existing Playwright tests and run them in a Playwright Check Suite by relying on [Playwright projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects).

Use the `pwProjects` option to choose Playwright projects defined in the `playwright.config.ts` by name.

<CodeGroup>
```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={10}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Multiple Browser Suite",
        logicalId: "browser-compat-e2e-suite",
        // Specify which projects should be
        // included in the Playwright Check Suite
        pwProjects: ["chromium", "firefox"],
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

```typescript playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      testMatch: /.*\/example-1\/.*\.spec\.ts/,
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
      },
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      testMatch: /.*\/example-1\/.*\.spec\.ts/,
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Firefox"],
      },
    },
  ],
})
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Playwright projects are most commonly used to configure different browser settings, but they can be used to configure different environments, authentication states, or any other Playwright configuration.

Using `pwProjects` creates a custom `testCommand` that includes the exact same `npx playwright test --project` configuration.

[Find more Playwright project examples below](#recommendations-and-examples).
</Tip>

### Group your Tests using Playwright tags

Select existing Playwright tests and run them in a Playwright Check Suite by relying on [Playwright test annotations and tags](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests).

<CodeGroup>
```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={9}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Tagged Checkly Tests",
        logicalId: "tagged-tests",
        // Specify which tagged tests should be
        // included in the Playwright Check Suite
        pwTags: ["@checkly"],
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

```typescript example.spec.ts highlight={6}
import { expect, test } from "@playwright/test"

test(
  "Visit Checkly home page",
  // Annotate a test to reuse is for synthetic monitoring
  { tag: "@checkly" },
  async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/")

    // More test code ...
  }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Playwright Check Suites let you filter existing tests using `pwTags`. However, we recommend to always start with a separated Playwright project and reuse it via `pwProjects` in your `checkly.config.ts`.

This approach improves the maintainability and separates the Playwright test configuration (`playwright.config.ts`) from the Checkly monitoring configuration (`checkly.config.ts`).

Using `pwTags` creates a custom `testCommand` that includes the exact same `npx playwright test --grep @tag` configuration for your check suite to run.
</Tip>

## Recommendations and Examples

Synthetic monitoring with Playwright Check Suites is most effective when you organize your Playwright tests to match your monitoring needs. The best setup depends on your application and how quickly you want to receive alerts.

<Note>
[The following examples are also available on GitHub](https://github.com/checkly/playwright-check-suite-examples/) if you want to see them in action.
</Note>

### Group different environments

If you want to use your Playwright tests to monitor different environments (e.g., `staging, production, ...` or `/de, /fr, ...`, ), create Playwright projects for each environment target.

<Frame>
  ![Playwright Check Suites grouped by environment](/images/pwn-environment-grouping.png)
</Frame>

Specify a different `baseURL` options for each project.

```typescript playwright.config.ts highlight={7,14}
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "environment-staging",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        baseURL: "https://staging.checklyhq.com"
      },
    },
    {
      name: "environment-production",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        baseURL: "https://checklyhq.com",
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

<Tip>
`baseURL` is one example of using advanced Playwright configuration.

The Playwright test runner can always be configured at a global, project, or test level. If needed, set up your project:

- to increase timeouts for a slow environment (e.g. `timeout` or `expect.timeout`)
- to run more retries for an unstable environment (e.g. `retries`)
- to use different authentication for each environment (e.g. `storageState`)
</Tip>

And configure different monitoring configuration for each Playwright project in your Playwright Check Suite.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={8-12, 17-21}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Staging Environment",
        logicalId: "environment-staging",
        // Pick the Playwright project for the staging environment
        pwProjects: ["environment-staging"],
        // Run this Playwright Check Suite in one location every hour
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2", "af-south-1"],
      },
      {
        name: "Production Environment",
        logicalId: "environment-production",
        // Pick the Playwright project for the production environment
        pwProjects: ["environment-production"],
        // Run this Playwright check suite in three locations every ten minutes
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2", "af-south-1"],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Group specific application areas

If you want to use your Playwright tests to monitor different application areas (e.g. customer functionality, search, etc.), create [Playwright projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) and select files via [Playwright annotations and tags](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests).

<Frame>
  ![Playwright Check Suites monitoring different application areas.](/images/pwn-use-case-grouping.png)
</Frame>

Select and group tests via Playwright projects.

```typescript playwright.config.ts highlight={6,11}
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "user-sign-up",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
      grep: /@signup/,
    },
    {
      name: "search",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
      grep: /@search/,
    },
  ],
})
```

And configure different monitoring configuration for each Playwright project in your Playwright Check Suite.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={8-12, 17-21}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "User Sign-up Suite",
        logicalId: "user-sign-up",
        // Pick the Playwright project covering user sign ups
        pwProjects: ["user-sign-up"],
        // Run this Playwright Check Suite in one location every hour
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
        locations: ["us-west-1"],
      },
      {
        name: "Search Suite",
        logicalId: "search",
        // Pick the Playwright project covering search functionality
        pwProjects: ["search"],
        // Run this Playwright check suite in three locations every ten minutes
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2", "af-south-1"],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

### Group tests depending on urgency or execution time

If you want to use your Playwright tests to monitor both essential user flows, like login at a high frequency with critical alerts, and less critical ones, like profile updates at a lower frequency, create [Playwright projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) and select tests via [Playwright annotations and tags](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-annotations#tag-tests).

<Frame>
  ![Two Playwright Check Suites grouped by urgency](/images/pwn-urgency-grouping.png)
</Frame>

Select and group tests via Playwright projects.

```typescript playwright.config.ts highlight={6,11}
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "critical",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
      grep: /@critical/,
    },
    {
      name: "important",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
      grep: /@important/,
    },
  ],
})
```

And configure different monitoring configuration for each Playwright project in your Playwright Check Suite.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={8-14, 19-25}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Critical Application Flows",
        logicalId: "critical",
        // Pick the `critical` project
        pwProjects: ["critical"],
        // Run this Playwright Check Suite in three locations every 5 minutes
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_5M,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2", "af-south-1"],
        // Assign critical alert channels
        alertChannels: [criticalPagerDuty, criticalSlack],
      },
      {
        name: "Important Application Flows",
        logicalId: "important",
        // Pick the `important` project
        pwProjects: ["important"],
        // Run this Playwright check suite in two locations every thirty minutes
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
        locations: ["us-west-1", "eu-west-2"],
        // Assign important alert channels
        alertChannels: [importantPagerDuty, importantSlack],
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

<Tip>
Critical Playwright Check Suites running on high intervals should only include fast test cases to guarantee a short Mean Time to Detect (MTTD).

**If a Check Suite run exceeds the specified interval frequency, subsequent runs will be skipped while it is running.**
</Tip>

### Group tests to reuse authentication states

If your existing Playwright tests require authentication and a login step, use [Playwright project dependencies and storage state](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-global-setup-teardown#option-1-project-dependencies) to log in once and reuse the browser session information.

Create a Playwright test that performs your login actions and calls [`context().storageState()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-storage-state).

```typescript login.setup.ts
const AUTH_FILE = ".auth/user.json"

setup("Log into Checkly", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/")

  // Perform your login actions
  // ...

  // Use storage state to write the browser state to disk
  await page.context().storageState({ path: AUTH_FILE })
})
```

Configure two new Playwright projects. The first one performs the login actions to persist the browser state, while the other one imports the browser state to avoid the login steps.

```typescript playwright.config.ts highlight={15, 18}
export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: "login-setup",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        baseURL: "https://checklyhq.com"
      },
    },
    {
      name: "logged-in-tests",
      use: {
        ...devices["Desktop Chrome"],
        // 2. Reuse the written browser state to avoid login steps
        storageState: path.resolve(__dirname, AUTH_FILE),
      },
      // 1. Set the project doing the login as a dependency
      dependencies: ["login-setup"],
    },
  ],
})
```

This Playwright setup will always run the `login-setup` project before running `logged-in-tests` so that the authentication will be available and the browser state can be reused.

Reuse the `logged-in-tests` project in your Checkly configuration.

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={9}
export default defineConfig({
  checks: {
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: "Logged-in tests",
        logicalId: "logged-in-tests",
        // Run the `logged-in-tests` project which will automatically run
        // `login-setup` to write the authentication file to disk
        pwProjects: ["logged-in-tests"],
        frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1H,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

Project dependencies and storage state work the same way as your standard Playwright project.
