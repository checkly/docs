import CliInstallation from '/snippets/cli-installation.mdx';
import CliProjectInit from '/snippets/cli-project-init.mdx';

<Note>
See [the general quickstart guide](quickstart/browser-check/) if you want to start creating your monitoring in the Checkly app first.
</Note>

The Checkly CLI enables monitoring as code, allowing you to create, test, and deploy synthetic monitoring checks directly from your codebase. Write checks in JavaScript/TypeScript, test them locally, and deploy them to Checkly's global monitoring infrastructure.

## Installing

**Recommended approach:** Create a new project with the CLI:

<CliProjectInit/>

**Alternative:** Install as a dev dependency in existing projects:

<CliInstallation/>

Recommended: Install [jiti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jiti) to use TypeScript for your Checkly monitoring setup.

```bash Terminal
npm i --save-dev jiti
```

Then, discover all available commands using:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly --help
```

## Checking the Version
```bash Terminal
npx checkly --version
```
