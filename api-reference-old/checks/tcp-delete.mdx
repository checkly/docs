## Overview

The Delete TCP Check endpoint permanently removes a TCP monitoring check from your account. This action cannot be undone and will stop all network monitoring for the deleted check.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Check Cleanup
- Network Monitoring Decommissioning
- Resource Management
- Service Retirement

<Warning>
Deleting TCP checks is permanent and cannot be undone. All historical connectivity data and network metrics will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

<Note>
Consider deactivating checks instead of deleting them to preserve historical network monitoring data and connectivity trends.
