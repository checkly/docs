## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through your application's services and infrastructure. It helps you:

- Understand request flow across services
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Debug failures and errors
- Optimize application performance

With telemetry traces configured, you will have access to traces in all the places where it matters to more quickly resolve issues:

- **Check results:** resolve production outages faster by correlating failing checks with infrastructure traces.
- **Test sessions:** understand any failures during test session execution.
- **Check editors:** get a live trace while building, editing and debugging check code.

## Getting Started with Checkly Traces

To get started with Checkly Traces using OpenTelemetry, pick the scenario that best fits your needs.

<Columns cols={3} >
<Card title="I don't have an OpenTelemetry setup" href="/docs/traces-open-telemetry/instrumenting-code/">
Instrument your app and send traces directly to Checkly. No need for a 3rd party OTel backend.
</Card>

<Card title="I already have an OTEL Collector" href="/docs/traces-open-telemetry/importing-traces/">
Send your infrastructure traces to Checkly to get contextualized check failure analysis.
</Card>

<Card title="I want to export Check results to my OpenTelemetry setup" href="/docs/traces-open-telemetry/exporting-traces/">

Export check results as traces to your 3rd party OTel tooling

## Key Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Cost-Effective Tracing">
Only traces generated by Checkly checks are forwarded to third-party tools, significantly reducing data transfer costs while maintaining comprehensive monitoring coverage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unified Observability">
Combine synthetic monitoring data with application traces in your existing observability platform for a complete picture of system health.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Faster Debugging">
When checks fail, trace data provides immediate context about what happened in your application stack, accelerating root cause analysis.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Seamless Integration">
Works with existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation and popular observability platforms without requiring changes to your application logic.
