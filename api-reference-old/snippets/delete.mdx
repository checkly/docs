## Overview

The Delete Snippet endpoint permanently removes a code snippet from your account. This action cannot be undone and will cause failures in any checks that reference the deleted snippet.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Code Cleanup
- Unused Snippet Removal
- Resource Management
- Account Maintenance

<Warning>
Deleting snippets is permanent and will cause failures in any checks that reference them. Ensure no active checks depend on the snippet before deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
Before deleting snippets, review all checks to ensure they don't reference the snippet. Consider updating dependent checks first.
