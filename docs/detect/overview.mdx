## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Checkly To Your Project">
Start with the monitoring approach that best fits your immediate needs:
- **Testing** for development and CI/CD validation
- **Uptime Monitoring** for basic availability tracking
- **Synthetic Monitoring** for comprehensive user experience validation
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Your First Check">
Set up monitoring for your most critical application components:
- Identify key endpoints or workflows
- Select appropriate monitoring locations
- Configure alerting and notification preferences
</Step>

<Step title="Test Your Application In CI/CD">
Build comprehensive monitoring by adding additional check types:
- Layer different monitoring approaches
- Cover all critical user journeys
- Monitor from multiple global locations
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy Your Checks For Production Monitoring">
Refine your monitoring based on insights and growing needs:
- Adjust thresholds based on performance data
- Add monitoring for new features and services
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines and development workflows
</Step>
</Steps>
