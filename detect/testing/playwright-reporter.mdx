</Frame>

Use the Playwright Reporter to seamlessly integrate Playwright test results with Checkly monitoring. Automatically upload test results, screenshots, videos, and traces to gain visibility into your application's health across test runs.

**Fully compatible with Playwright's native JSON reporter** - use it as a drop-in replacement that adds Checkly integration.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before using the Playwright reporter, ensure you:

- use Node.js >= 18.0.0
- use Playwright >= 1.40.0
- have a Checkly account ([sign up](https://www.checklyhq.com/signup))
</Accordion>

## Install the Playwright Reporter

Install [the Playwright reporter package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@checkly/playwright-reporter) via npm.

```bash
npm install --save-dev @checkly/playwright-reporter
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create an API key and get your Account ID

To start pushing your Playwright test reports to Checkly you need to authenticate the reporter with your Checkly Account ID and an API Key.

1. [Log in to Checkly](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Navigate to [your account Settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general) to get your account id (Account Settings > General)
3. Create a new API key in [your user settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys) (User Settings > API Keys)

Define your account id and API key as environment variables.

```bash
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=cu_123...
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=b2f...
```

The Playwright reporter will automatically pick up the environment variables `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID`.

<Tip>
If you can't set environment variables use inline environment variables when running Playwright:

```bash
CHECKLY_API_KEY=... CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=... npx playwright test
```
</Tip>

### 2. Add the reporter to your Playwright configuration

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    createChecklyReporter(),
  ],
});
```

<Tip>
Using `createChecklyReporter()` provides full intellisense for configuration options. Alternatively, use the array syntax: `['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {}]`
</Tip>

### 3. Run your tests

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You'll see real-time test progress and a session URL in the output:

## Configuration

### Reporter Options

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from '@playwright/test';
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    ['list'],
    createChecklyReporter({
      // Directory for assets, JSON, and ZIP output
      outputDir: 'test-results',

      // Custom session name (string or function)
      sessionName: 'My Test Suite',

      // Skip API calls, only create local ZIP
      dryRun: false,

      // Enable debug logging
      verbose: false,

      // Show real-time test progress (default: true)
      showProgress: true,

      // Show individual test steps in progress output
      printSteps: false,

      // Show per-project summary table (default: true, set false to disable)
      showSummaryTable: true,
    }),
  ],
});
```

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `outputDir` | `string` | Playwright's `outputDir` | Directory for assets, JSON, and ZIP |
| `sessionName` | `string \| function` | Auto-generated | Custom session name |
| `dryRun` | `boolean` | `false` | Create ZIP without uploading |
| `verbose` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable debug logging |
| `showProgress` | `boolean` | `true` | Show real-time test progress |
| `printSteps` | `boolean` | `false` | Show individual test steps |
| `showSummaryTable` | `boolean` | `true` | Show per-project breakdown table |

**Output files** (written to `outputDir`):
- `checkly-report.json` - JSON test report
- `checkly-report.zip` - ZIP archive with report and assets

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `CHECKLY_API_KEY` | Your Checkly API key |
| `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Checkly account ID |
| `CHECKLY_REPORTER_VERBOSE` | Set to `true` for detailed debug output |

<Warning>
**Security Note**: Always use environment variables for credentials. Never commit API keys to version control.
</Warning>

## What Gets Uploaded

- Test results and status (passed/failed/flaky)
- Execution duration and timing
- Screenshots (on failure or explicit capture)
- Video recordings
- Playwright traces
- Console logs and network requests (extracted from traces)
- Git information (branch, commit, author) - automatically detected from CI or local git

<Tip>
If your Checkly reports don't include traces or videos, ensure that your `playwright.config.ts` enables these Playwright features. The reporter only uploads what your Playwright test run creates.
</Tip>

## Features

### Real-time Test Progress

See test results as they run with status icons, error details, and a summary table. Similar to Playwright's built-in `line` reporter but with Checkly integration.

Disable with `showProgress: false` if using another reporter for terminal output.

### Summary Table

A per-project breakdown of test results is shown by default. Disable with `showSummaryTable: false`.

```
┌─────────────────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬───────┬─────────┐
│ Project         │ Total │  Pass │  Fail │ Flaky │  Skip │    Rate │
├─────────────────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼───────┼─────────┤
│ chromium        │    10 │     9 │     0 │     1 │     0 │  90.00% │
│ firefox         │    10 │    10 │     0 │     0 │     0 │ 100.00% │
│ webkit          │    10 │     8 │     2 │     0 │     0 │  80.00% │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Multi-Provider Git Detection

Git information (branch, commit, author) is automatically detected from any CI provider:

- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- CircleCI
- Travis CI
- Azure DevOps
- Bitbucket Pipelines

When running locally, git info is extracted directly from your repository.

### Flaky Test Detection

The reporter automatically detects flaky tests:

- **Flaky test**: A test that failed initially but passed after retry
- **Degraded status**: Set when there are flaky tests but no complete failures
- **Overall status**: `passed` if all tests eventually pass, `failed` otherwise

### Test Step Code Snippets

Test steps include source code context in the report. When viewing step details, you'll see the exact line of code that executed along with surrounding context, making debugging easier.

## Running Locally (No Upload)

For local development without uploading to Checkly:

```bash
# Don't set CHECKLY_API_KEY or CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
npx playwright test
```

What happens:
- Reporter creates `checkly-report.zip` locally
- Upload is automatically skipped
- Tests run normally
- You can inspect the ZIP file for debugging

## Dry Run Mode

Create local JSON and ZIP files without uploading:

```ts playwright.config.ts
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: true,
})
```

Conditional dry run (upload only in CI):

```ts playwright.config.ts
createChecklyReporter({
  dryRun: !process.env.CI,
})
```

## Multiple Reporters

Combine with other Playwright reporters:

```ts playwright.config.ts
import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter';

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
    createChecklyReporter(),
    ['html', { outputFolder: 'playwright-report' }],
    ['list'],
    ['junit', { outputFile: 'test-results/junit.xml' }],
  ],
});
```

## Understanding Test Sessions

The reporter creates **suite-level test sessions**, not individual test file results.

When you run `npx playwright test`:

1. **One test session** is created, named after your directory
2. **One test result** for the entire run
3. **All assets uploaded together** in a single ZIP file

Benefits:
- Consolidated view of your entire test suite
- Efficient storage
- Track overall pass/fail rates over time
