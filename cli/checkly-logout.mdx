The `checkly logout` command signs out of your current Checkly account and removes stored authentication tokens from your local machine.

## Usage

Log out of your current Checkly account.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly logout
```

## Extended Usage

The logout process displays confirmation of successful logout and token removal.

```bash Terminal                
npx checkly logout
✓ Successfully logged out from user@company.com
✓ Authentication tokens removed
```

The logout process will:
1. **Invalidate your session** on Checkly servers
2. **Remove local tokens** from your machine
3. **Require re-authentication** for future CLI usage

## Unique Options

This command has no unique options - it performs a simple logout operation.

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli/checkly-global-options):

- [`--verbose`](/cli/checkly-global-options#verbose-or-v) - Show detailed logout process

## What Happens During Logout

### Token Removal
The command removes authentication tokens stored locally in:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/checkly-cli/`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/checkly-cli/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\checkly-cli\`

### Session Invalidation
Your active session is invalidated on Checkly servers, requiring fresh authentication for any future CLI usage.

## After Logout

Once logged out, you'll need to run [`checkly login`](/cli/checkly-login) before using other CLI commands that require authentication.

Commands that require authentication include:
- `checkly deploy`
- `checkly test --record`
- `checkly trigger`
- `checkly env`
- `checkly import`

## Related Commands

- [`checkly login`](/cli/checkly-login) - Authenticate with your Checkly account
- [`checkly whoami`](/cli/checkly-whoami) - Display current account information
- [`checkly switch`](/cli/checkly-switch) - Switch between multiple accounts

## Use Cases

### Security Best Practice
Log out when using shared or public computers:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly logout
```

### Account Switching
Log out before switching to a different account:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly logout
npx checkly login
```

### CI/CD Cleanup
Include logout in CI/CD scripts for security:

```bash Terminal
# Deploy checks
npx checkly deploy

# Clean up authentication
npx checkly logout
```
