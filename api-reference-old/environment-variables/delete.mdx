## Overview

The Delete Environment Variable endpoint permanently removes an environment variable from your Checkly account. Once deleted, the variable will no longer be available to any checks or scripts.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Variable Cleanup
- Security Maintenance
- Configuration Management
- Unused Variable Removal

<Warning>
Deleting environment variables is permanent and will cause failures in any checks or scripts that reference them. Ensure no active monitoring depends on the variable before deletion.
</Warning>

<Note>
Before deleting variables, review all checks and scripts to ensure they don't reference the variable. Consider updating or disabling dependent checks first.
