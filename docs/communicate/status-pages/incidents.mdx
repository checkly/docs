    - Any 2+ checks failure → Major Impact Incident
    - All checks recovery → Automatic Resolution

# Complex service dependencies
Website Availability:
  Description: "Main website functionality"
  Connected Checks:
    - Homepage Load Check
    - User Registration Check
    - Search Functionality Check
  Automation Rules:
    - Homepage failure → Major Impact
    - Other check failures → Minor Impact
    - Gradual recovery → Status updates
```

<Warning>
When multiple checks are connected to a single service, Checkly uses intelligent logic to determine incident severity. Consider your check dependencies when configuring automation.
</Warning>

## Incident Updates and Communication

### Managing Subscriber Communications

<Tip>
Consider your audience when writing incident updates. Use clear, non-technical language that your users can understand, and focus on impact rather than technical details.
</Tip>

```yaml
# Communication strategy by incident type
Major Impact Incidents:
  Tone: Urgent but calm
  Detail Level: High impact information
  Technical Details: Minimal
  Timeline Updates: Frequent
  
Minor Impact Incidents:
  Tone: Informative
  Detail Level: Moderate impact information  
  Technical Details: Limited
  Timeline Updates: Regular

Maintenance Windows:
  Tone: Informational
  Detail Level: Clear scope and timing
  Technical Details: User-relevant only
  Timeline Updates: As scheduled
```

## Historical Incident Management

### Incident Backfilling
Add historical incidents to maintain accurate status page records:

<Steps>
<Step title="Historical Analysis">
Review past outages and incidents that should be documented
</Step>

<Step title="Incident Creation">
Create incidents with historical dates and times
</Step>

<Step title="Notification Settings">
Choose whether to notify current subscribers about historical events
</Step>

<Step title="Status Impact">
Historical incidents affect uptime calculations and reporting
</Step>
</Steps>

### Backfilling Best Practices

<Warning>
When backfilling historical incidents, typically disable subscriber notifications to avoid confusion about past events. Users don't need to be notified about incidents that already occurred before they subscribed.
</Warning>

```yaml
# Backfilling configuration example
Historical Incident: "Database Maintenance - December 2023"
Date: 2023-12-15 02:00 UTC
Duration: 4 hours
Type: Maintenance
Services Affected:
  - All Services: Maintenance
Notify Subscribers: false
Include in Uptime: true
Purpose: Accurate historical uptime reporting
```

### Uptime Calculation Impact
Historical incidents are included in uptime statistics:

- **Monthly uptime**: Calculated including all incidents in the month
- **Yearly uptime**: Annual statistics reflect all documented incidents  
- **SLA reporting**: Historical data supports accurate SLA reporting
- **Trend analysis**: Complete incident history enables better trend analysis

## Advanced Incident Features

### Cross-Page Incident Propagation
Incidents can affect multiple status pages when services are shared:

```yaml
# Multi-page incident example
Shared Service: "Core Authentication API"
Connected Pages:
  - Main Product Status Page
  - Developer Portal Status Page
  - Customer Support Page

Incident Impact:
  - Incident created on all connected pages
  - Updates propagated to all status pages
  - Resolution synchronized across pages
  - Subscriber notifications sent from each page
```

### Incident Analytics and Reporting
Track incident patterns and performance:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Incident metrics" icon="chart-bar">
**Performance Tracking**
- Mean time to detection (MTTD)
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)  
- Incident frequency analysis

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### API Integration for Incidents
Programmatically manage incidents through Checkly's API:

```javascript
// Create incident via API
const incident = await checkly.incidents.create({
  title: "Payment API Performance Issues",
  type: "minor_impact",
  services: [
    {
      id: "payment-service-id",
      status: "performance_issues"
    }
  ],
  message: "We are experiencing slower than normal response times",
  notify_subscribers: true
});

// Update incident status
await checkly.incidents.update(incident.id, {
  status: "identified",
  message: "Issue identified, implementing fix",
  notify_subscribers: true
});

// Resolve incident
await checkly.incidents.resolve(incident.id, {
  message: "Issue resolved, all systems operational",
  notify_subscribers: true
});
```

## Incident Response Best Practices

### Preparation
- **Pre-written templates**: Prepare incident message templates for common scenarios
- **Response team training**: Ensure team knows how to create and update incidents
- **Escalation procedures**: Define when and how to escalate incident communication
- **Contact management**: Maintain up-to-date subscriber lists and communication channels

### During Incidents
- **Rapid initial response**: Acknowledge issues quickly, even without full details
- **Regular updates**: Provide status updates even if there's no new information
- **Clear communication**: Use simple language that all users can understand
- **Honest transparency**: Be direct about issues and expected resolution times

### Post-Incident
- **Detailed resolution**: Explain what was fixed and preventive measures
- **Lessons learned**: Document incident response improvements
- **Process updates**: Refine incident procedures based on experience
- **Follow-up communication**: Consider additional communication for major incidents

<Note>
Effective incident management builds trust with your users. Transparent, timely communication during incidents often strengthens customer relationships rather than damaging them.
</Note>

<Tip>
Use incident automation to ensure rapid response times, but always be prepared to provide manual updates with context and empathy that automation cannot provide.
