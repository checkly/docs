## Custom domain

<Note>
  Custom domains are available on Communicate Starter, Team and Enterprise
  plans. [View pricing](https://checklyhq.com/pricing)
</Note>

You can host your Status Page on your own domain. To set it up, add the domain in Checkly and create the required DNS records with your DNS provider.

<Steps>

</Step>

<Step title="Create a CNAME record that points to `custom-slug.checkly-status-page.com`">
  Create a CNAME record with your DNS provider and point it to
  `custom-slug.checkly-status-page.com` For example, in Cloudflare, the
  configuration looks like this: ![Custom domain CNAME
  configuration](/images/docs/images/status-pages/status-pages-custom-domain-2.png)
  If your provider is Cloudflare, you must disable the proxy on the CNAME, it
  should always be set to DNS only.
</Step>

<Step title="Add or update TXT record(s) to perform validation and prove domain ownership">
After you've added your custom domain and saved the page, one or more TXT records will be displayed depending on the domain you're using. 
![Example custom domain TXT configuration](/images/docs/images/status-pages/status-pages-custom-domain-3.png)

Update your DNS settings to match the TXT record(s) displayed on your Status Page to prove the ownership of the domain.

<Note>
Search engines require this verification to index and list your Status Page.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Add validation `TXT` record(s)">
Copy the validation TXT record(s) from the Status Page configuration after you've added your custom domain and save the page.
