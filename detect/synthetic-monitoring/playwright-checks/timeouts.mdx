Playwright Check Suites have multiple timeout stages during execution.
Use this guide to configure your checks and troubleshoot timeout failures.

## Timeout overview

| Timeout stage | Default timeout | Configurable |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Global Playwright Check Suite timeout | 30 minutes | No |
| Dependency installation | 5 minutes | No |
| Playwright test timeout | Inherits from your config | Yes |
| Playwright navigation timeout | Inherits from your config | Yes |
| Playwright action timeout | Inherits from your config | Yes |
| Artifact upload and secret scrubbing | No timeout | No |

## Playwright Check Suite execution stages

When Checkly runs your Playwright Check Suite, it has a global timeout of 30 minutes, while going through these stages:

### 1. Pre-processing

Checkly prepares your execution environment:

1. **Playwright and browsers**: Load the right playwright version with its corresponding browsers
2. **Dependencies cache download**: Downloads the dependencies cache if it exists
3. **Dependency installation**: If the dependencies cache doesn't exist, Checkly runs the install command (default: `npm install`, `pnpm install` or `yarn install`)
   - This stage has a **5-minute timeout**
   - Use `installCommand` in your [check suite configuration](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/configuration#customize-install-and-test-commands) to run a custom dependency installation command. This can help prevent timeouts during installation. For example `installCommand: 'npm install --ignore-scripts'` to skip running postinstall and other lifecycle scripts
4. **Creates and uploads new dependencies cache**: This cache will be used in consecutive runs in your account with the same dependencies

### 2. Test execution

Checkly runs your tests using `npx playwright test`:

- The timeouts of this stage are set through the timeouts in your Playwright tests and configuration.
- To set a global playwright test timeout in Checkly, use a custom test command, `testCommand` , in your [check suite configuration](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/configuration#customize-install-and-test-commands)
  - Use `testCommand: npx playwright test --global-timeout=<timeout_in_ms>` to customize the timeout of this step

### 3. Post-processing

After tests complete, Checkly:

1. **Uploads artifacts**: Screenshots, videos, traces
2. **Scrubs secrets**: Removes secrets declared in your Checkly Environment Secrets from logs and artifacts


## Playwright-specific timeouts

Checkly runs your tests with the timeout configuration from your `playwright.config.ts` and test files. Configure test timeout, navigation timeout, and action timeout according to your needs. See [Playwright's timeout documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts) for detailed configuration options.

## Troubleshooting timeout-related errors

### Dependency installation timeout exceeded

```
Running <npm/yarn/pnpm install command>
Command timed out
Failed to run install command
```

**Cause**: Dependencies take longer than 5 minutes to install.

**Solutions**:
- Reduce dependencies in your `package.json`
- Remove large or unnecessary packages
- Check if your registry is slow or has issues
- Update and commit your lock file

See the [Custom dependencies troubleshooting guide](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/custom-dependencies#troubleshooting) for more detailed solutions.

### Global timeout exceeded

```
Your check took too long to complete and was automatically stopped. If this issue persists, please contact support at ...
```

**Cause**: The entire check suite execution (installation + tests + post-processing) exceeded 30 minutes.


**Solution**:
- Split tests into multiple check suites using `pwTags`, `pwProjects` or a custom `testCommand`. 


### Playwright test timeout exceeded

```
Error: Test timeout of 30000ms exceeded
```

**Cause**: A single test exceeded the configured test timeout.

**Solution**: Increase the test timeout in your Playwright configuration or for specific tests. See [Playwright's test timeout documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts#test-timeout) for configuration options.

### Playwright navigation timeout exceeded

```
Error: page.goto: Timeout 30000ms exceeded
```

**Cause**: A navigation action (like `page.goto()`) took longer than the navigation timeout.

**Solution**: Increase the navigation timeout in your Playwright configuration or for specific navigation actions. See [Playwright's timeout documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts) for configuration options.

### Playwright action timeout exceeded

```
Error: locator.click: Timeout 10000ms exceeded
```

**Cause**: An action (click, fill, etc.) took longer than the configured action timeout.

**Solution**: Increase the action timeout in your Playwright configuration or for specific actions. See [Playwright's timeout documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-timeouts) for configuration options.
