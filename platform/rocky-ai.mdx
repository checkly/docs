Rocky AI is Checkly's AI agent. Rocky AI can help you automatically determine user impact and root cause on any failing
check using error messages, code, metrics, traces and logs.

## Rocky AI capabilities

Rocky AI's current core capabilities are **Root Cause & User Impact Analysis** for failing checks and
test results. Read more about [AI root cause analysis in the resolve section](/resolve/ai-root-cause-analysis/overview).

*We are planning more capabilities for Rocky across the Detect, Communicate and Resolve categories.*

## Getting Started with Rocky AI

To get started with Rocky AI follow these steps:

1. Make sure [Rocky AI is enabled in its settings page](https://app.checklyhq.com/accounts/rocky-ai).
2. Now look for Rocky AI buttons and options in the Checkly web interface.

## Data Privacy and Security

- All AI features are designed to operate on the data you provide or the data generated by your checks. This data is already
stored in Checkly, and we do not send any additional data to third-party AI providers.

- Any provided [environment secrets](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/variables/) are scrubbed before being sent
to the AI provider.

- We do not train any custom models on your data.

- Any data used by the AI features is processed in real-time and not stored for future training.

## Built-in and Custom Models

By default, Checkly uses OpenAI's GPT-5.1 model for AI features. However, you can also bring your own model (BYOM) and provider to Checkly.
To do this, you need to set up a custom AI provider in the [AI settings screen](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/ai).

<Info>
  The Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature is available for Enterprise customers only.
