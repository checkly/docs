## Benefits of Uptime Monitoring
Uptime monitoring continuously checks if your applications and services are accessible and responding correctly. Typical use cases include:

- Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
- Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
- Monitoring database connectivity with TCP checks
- Confirming heartbeat endpoints are responding in your CI/CD pipeline


## Alerting
Uptime Monitors can be configure to alert when:
- a status code returns a value not equal to the set status code
- a response time exceeds a set thresholds

To learn more about alerting, see [Alerting](/docs/introduction/concepts/alerting).

## Scheduling
Uptime Monitors are scheduled to run at a frequency that is appropriate for the service being monitored - you can change the frequency in the Checkly dashboard or via your configuration files. 

To learn more about scheduling, see [Scheduling](/docs/introduction/concepts/scheduling).

## Locations
Uptime Monitors can be configured to run from multiple locations around the world. This helps you ensure your application is available from all parts of the world.

To learn more about locations, see [Locations](/docs/introduction/concepts/locations).
