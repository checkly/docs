## Overview

Create a new [check group](/platform/groups) to organize related checks and apply shared settings. Check groups help you manage multiple checks efficiently by providing common configuration, environment variables, and alert channels.

<Note>
  You can add checks to a group by setting the "groupId" property of individual checks.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Groups created with this endpoint will always override its member check settings (i.e. location, alerting, etc.). We recommend using the [V2 endpoint](/api-reference/check-groups/create/) instead for more flexibility.
