Single Sign-On (SSO) enables businesses to secure employee access across a variety of third-party services. Currently, Checkly supports the following SSO protocols:

1. [SAML](/docs/introduction/platform/admin/saml)
2. [Microsoft Azure AD](/docs/introduction/platform/admin/microsoft-azure-ad)

If you are interested in using Checkly with a different SSO protocol, please [reach out to Support](mailto:support@checklyhq.com).

<Note>
SSO is only available for Checkly's [enterprise plans](/pricing/).
