# Quick Start Guide

Follow this step-by-step guide to set up your first Private Location and start monitoring internal systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Checkly Account**: Owner or Admin permissions
- **Infrastructure**: Container runtime (Docker, Podman, or similar)
- **Network Access**: Outbound HTTPS to `agent.checklyhq.com`
- **Target Access**: Network connectivity to your applications

## Step 1: Create Your Private Location

Navigate to [Private Locations](https://app.checklyhq.com/private-locations) and click "New private location":

Provide a descriptive name and choose an icon that represents your location or environment.

## Step 2: Secure Your API Key

Copy and securely store the generated API key. This key authenticates your agents with Checkly:

<Warning>
The API key is only shown once during creation. Store it securely in your secrets management system.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Deploy Your First Agent

Start a Checkly Agent using Docker:

```bash
docker run -e API_KEY="pl_your_api_key_here" -d checkly/agent:latest
```

For production deployments, consider:
- Using specific version tags instead of `latest`
- Using the [dev image](/platform/private-locations/dev-agent) if your checks require native modules
- Configuring resource limits and restart policies
- Setting up monitoring and logging for the agent containers

## Step 4: Verify Agent Connection

Refresh your Private Locations page to see your active agents:

The interface shows:
- Number of active agents
- Last connection time
- Agent health status

## Step 5: Configure Your Checks

When creating checks, select your Private Location from the available locations:

Deselect other locations to ensure your checks run exclusively from your Private Location.

## Resource Requirements

<Info>
**Memory Guidelines:**
- API checks: ~150MB per concurrent check
- Browser checks: ~1.5GB per concurrent check
- Minimum recommended: 2 CPU cores, 4GB RAM for mixed workloads

<Tip>
Start small with a single agent to test connectivity and functionality, then scale based on your monitoring requirements and workload patterns.
