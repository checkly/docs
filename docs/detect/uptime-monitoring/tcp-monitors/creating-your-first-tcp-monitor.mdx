This guide walks you through creating your first TCP monitor to check the availability of your network services, databases, or any TCP-based application.

<Note>
You'll need a service running on a specific TCP port. If you don't have one ready, you can use a public service like a mail server or database for testing.
</Note>

## Step-by-Step Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Monitors">
1. Log into your Checkly dashboard
2. Go to **Monitors** in the main navigation
3. Click **Create Monitor** and select **TCP Monitor**

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Basic Settings">
Enter the essential details for your TCP monitor:

**Monitor Name**: Give your monitor a descriptive name
```
Production MySQL Database
```

**Host/IP Address**: The server you want to monitor
```
db.myapp.com
```

**Port**: The TCP port your service is listening on
```
3306
```

**Protocol**: Choose the appropriate protocol
- **TCP**: Standard TCP connection
- **SSL/TLS**: Encrypted connection
- **Custom**: For specific protocol requirements

</Step>

<Step title="Set Connection Options">
Configure how the monitor connects to your service:

**Connection Timeout**: Maximum time to wait for connection (default: 10 seconds)
```
15 seconds
```

**Read Timeout**: Time to wait for response after connection (default: 10 seconds)
```
10 seconds
```

<Tip>
Set timeouts slightly higher than your service's typical response time to avoid false alerts.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Response Validation (Optional)">
For more precise monitoring, validate the service response:

**Expected Response**: Text pattern that should appear in the response
```
MySQL Server
```

**Connection String**: Data to send after establishing connection
```
PING\n
```

<Warning>
Be careful with connection strings - some services may close connections after receiving unexpected data.
</Warning>

</Step>

<Step title="Choose Monitoring Locations">
Select where to run your TCP monitor from:

1. **Global Locations**: Monitor from multiple continents
2. **Regional Focus**: Choose locations near your users
3. **Private Locations**: Use your own monitoring infrastructure

**Recommended setup**: Start with 3-5 locations spread across different regions.

![Select monitoring locations](/images/docs/images/tcp-monitors/tcp-monitor-locations.png)
</Step>

<Step title="Set Monitoring Frequency">
Choose how often to check your service:

- **Every minute**: For critical services requiring immediate detection
- **Every 5 minutes**: Good balance for most production services  
- **Every 15 minutes**: For stable services with less critical requirements
- **Custom interval**: Set specific timing needs

```
Every 5 minutes
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure SSL/TLS (If Applicable)">
For encrypted connections, enable SSL/TLS monitoring:

**SSL Certificate Validation**: Check certificate validity and expiration
- ✅ Verify certificate chain
- ✅ Check expiration date (alert 30 days before)
- ✅ Validate hostname matching

**SSL Protocols**: Choose minimum required version
```
TLS 1.2 or higher
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Alerting">
Configure when and how you'll be notified of issues:

**Alert Conditions**:
- ✅ Connection failure
- ✅ Timeout exceeded  
- ✅ Response validation failed
- ✅ SSL certificate issues

**Alert Channels**: Choose your notification methods
- Email alerts
- Slack notifications  
- Webhook integrations
- SMS alerts (premium feature)

</Step>

<Step title="Test and Save">
Before saving, test your monitor configuration:

1. Click **Test Monitor** to run a test check
2. Review the test results for any issues
3. Adjust configuration if needed
4. Click **Create Monitor** to save

The test will show:
- ✅ Connection successful
- ✅ Response time: 45ms
- ✅ Response validation passed
- ✅ SSL certificate valid (if applicable)
</Step>
</Steps>

## Common Configuration Examples

### Database Server (MySQL)
```yaml
Name: Production MySQL
Host: db.production.com
Port: 3306
Protocol: TCP
Connection Timeout: 15s
Expected Response: (leave empty for basic connectivity)
```

### SMTP Mail Server
```yaml
Name: Mail Server SMTP
Host: mail.company.com  
Port: 587
Protocol: SSL/TLS
Connection Timeout: 10s
Expected Response: "220"
```

### Redis Cache Server
```yaml
Name: Redis Cache
Host: redis.internal.com
Port: 6379
Protocol: TCP
Connection String: "PING\r\n"
Expected Response: "+PONG"
```

### SSH Server
```yaml
Name: Production SSH
Host: server.example.com
Port: 22
Protocol: TCP
Expected Response: "SSH-2.0"
```



<Note>
TCP monitors provide network-level connectivity verification. For application-level monitoring, consider adding HTTP/API checks and synthetic monitoring to your monitoring strategy.
