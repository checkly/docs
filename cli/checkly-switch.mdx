## Unique Options

This command has no unique options - it provides interactive account selection.

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli/checkly-global-options):

- [`--verbose`](/cli/checkly-global-options#verbose-or-v) - Show detailed account information during selection

## Account Access Requirements

### Multiple Account Access
To use the switch command, you must have access to multiple Checkly accounts through:

- **Team memberships** across different organizations
- **Client projects** where you're added as a collaborator
- **Personal accounts** plus organizational accounts
- **Service accounts** with cross-organization permissions

### Authentication Requirements
You must be logged in with credentials that have access to multiple accounts. If you only have access to one account, the switch command will display a message indicating no alternative accounts are available.

## Account Information Display

For each available account, the selection interface shows:

- **Account name** and organization
- **Account ID** (unique identifier)
- **Subscription plan** (Free, Developer, Team, Enterprise)
- **Your role** in that account (Owner, Admin, Editor, Viewer)
- **Current status** (active account is marked)

## Related Commands

- [`checkly whoami`](/cli/checkly-whoami) - Display current active account
- [`checkly login`](/cli/checkly-login) - Authenticate with Checkly
- [`checkly logout`](/cli/checkly-logout) - Sign out of current account

## Use Cases

### Multi-Client Management
Switch between client accounts when managing multiple projects:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly switch
# Select client account
npx checkly deploy --config client-config.ts
```

### Environment Separation
Switch between accounts for different environments:

```bash Terminal
# Switch to staging account
npx checkly switch
npx checkly deploy --config staging.config.ts

# Switch to production account  
npx checkly switch
npx checkly deploy --config production.config.ts
```

### Team Collaboration
Switch to shared team accounts for collaborative work:

```bash Terminal    
npx checkly switch
# Select team account
npx checkly test --record --test-session-name "Team validation"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Alternative Accounts
If you see "No alternative accounts available":
- You only have access to one Checkly account
- Contact account administrators to request access to additional accounts
- Consider using separate authentication for different accounts

### Account Not Listed
If an expected account doesn't appear:
- Verify you have active access to that account
- Check that your user hasn't been removed from the account
- Try logging out and back in to refresh account permissions

### Permission Issues
After switching accounts, you may encounter different permissions:
- Each account has its own role-based access controls
- Verify your role in the new account supports your intended operations
- Some operations may require higher privileges in different accounts
