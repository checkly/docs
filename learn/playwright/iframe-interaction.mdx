Playwright enables us to access and interact with iframes.

## Locate an iframe and its elements

To access iframe elements, locate the iframe and query the DOM elements as if you're in the page context.

```ts iframe-access.spec.ts
import { test } from '@playwright/test'

test('access iframe content', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://your-page-with-an-iframe.com')
  const header = await page.frameLocator('iframe').locator('h1')
  console.log(await header.innerText())
})

```
