## Overview

The Get Group Status Badge endpoint generates status badges (SVG images) that display the overall health status of a check group. These badges aggregate the status of all checks within the group.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Service Group Status Display
- Project Health Indicators
- Team Dashboard Widgets
- Multi-Check Status Summary

**Response Format**: SVG image

<Note>
Group status badges reflect the combined health of all checks in the group. The badge will show degraded or failed status if any checks in the group are not passing.
