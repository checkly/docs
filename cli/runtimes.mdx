The `checkly runtimes` command displays all available runtime environments and their installed dependencies. This helps you understand what packages and versions are available for your checks in the Checkly cloud infrastructure.

## Usage

```bash Terminal
npx checkly runtimes
```

List all available runtimes with their dependency versions.

## Extended Usage

```bash Terminal
npx checkly runtimes
```

Example output:
```bash Terminal

## Unique Options

This command has no unique options - it displays runtime information only.

## Global Options

This command supports the following [global options](/cli/global-options):

- [`--verbose`](/cli/global-options#verbose-or-v) - Show additional runtime details

## Runtime Information

### Runtime Versions
Each runtime environment includes:

- **Runtime identifier** (e.g., `2024.02`)
- **Node.js version** and release information  
- **Playwright version** for browser automation
- **TypeScript version** for type checking
- **Built-in packages** and their versions

### Package Availability
Common packages included in Checkly runtimes:

- **HTTP clients**: axios, node-fetch, got
- **Utilities**: lodash, dayjs, moment
- **Testing**: expect, jest-extended
- **Cryptography**: crypto-js, jsonwebtoken
- **Data processing**: csv-parser, xml2js
- **Environment**: dotenv

### Runtime Selection
Runtimes are automatically selected based on:

- **Latest available** runtime by default
- **Project configuration** in `checkly.config.ts`
- **Backward compatibility** requirements
- **Package dependencies** in your checks

## Configuration

### Setting Runtime in Configuration
Specify a runtime version in your `checkly.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'checkly'

export default defineConfig({
  projectName: 'My Project',
  runtime: '2024.02', // Specific runtime version
  // ... other config
})
```

### Runtime Compatibility
When selecting a runtime, consider:

- **Package versions** your code depends on
- **Node.js features** you're using
- **Playwright compatibility** for browser checks
- **Long-term support** for production environments

## Use Cases

### Runtime Planning
Check available packages before writing checks:
```bash Terminal
npx checkly runtimes
# Review available packages and versions
# Write checks using compatible dependencies
```

### Version Compatibility
Verify package versions for existing checks:
```bash Terminal
npx checkly runtimes
# Compare with your package.json dependencies
# Update runtime configuration if needed
```

### Troubleshooting
Debug runtime-related issues:
```bash Terminal
npx checkly runtimes --verbose
# Review detailed runtime information
# Identify version conflicts or missing packages
```

### CI/CD Integration
Include runtime verification in workflows:
```bash Terminal  
# Verify runtime before deployment
npx checkly runtimes
npx checkly test
npx checkly deploy
```

## Best Practices

### Runtime Strategy
1. **Use latest runtime** for new projects to get latest features
2. **Pin specific versions** for production stability
3. **Test runtime changes** thoroughly before deployment
4. **Monitor runtime updates** for security patches

### Package Management
1. **Verify package availability** before using in checks
2. **Use built-in packages** when possible to reduce overhead
3. **Check version compatibility** with your development environment
4. **Document runtime requirements** in your project
