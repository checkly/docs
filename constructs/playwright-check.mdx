</Tip>

<PlaywrightCheckSuiteBetaNote />

Use Playwright Check Suites to reuse your existing Playwright test suite to run it as end-to-end tests and synthetic monitoring. The examples below show how to configure Playwright Check Suites for different testing and monitoring scenarios.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before creating Playwright Check Suites, ensure you have:

- An initialized Checkly CLI project
- A running Playwright test suite
- A public website you want to monitor
- Understanding of [Playwright test syntax and structure](/learn/playwright/overview)

For additional setup information, see [CLI overview](/cli/overview).
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>

```ts Basic Example
import { PlaywrightCheck } from "checkly/constructs"

new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
})
```

```ts Advanced Example
import { PlaywrightCheck } from "checkly/constructs"

new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
  installCommand: "npm ci",
  testCommand: "npx playwright test --retries=2",
  pwProjects: ["chromium"],
  pwTags: ["e2e"],
	// TODO check the include
  include: ["**/*.spec.ts"],
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Configuration

### Playwright Check Suite Options

<ResponseField name="playwrightConfigPath" type="string" required>

The path to the Playwright configuration file (`playwright.config.js/ts`) which defines test settings, browser configurations, and project structure.

**Usage:**

```ts
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
})
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="installCommand" type="string">

The command to install dependencies before running tests. This configuration is useful for ensuring test dependencies are available in the runtime environment.

Checkly defaults to using npm, but automatically detects other package managers if lock files are present.

**Usage:**

```ts
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  installCommand: "npm ci",
})
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="testCommand" type="string" default="npx playwright test">

The command to execute Playwright tests. The check will automatically append the specified Playwright config, project, and tag arguments.

TODO explain the resolution and collision

**Usage:**

```ts
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  testCommand: "npx playwright test --grep@checkly --config=playwright.foo.config.ts",
})
```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pwProjects" type="string">

The defined projects to run from your Playwright configuration.

**Usage:**

<CodeGroup>

```ts Single project
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwProjects: "chromium",
})
```

```ts Multiple projects
new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwProjects: ["chromium", "firefox"],
})
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>[Playwright Test Projects](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-projects) let you run different test files in different browsers and with different settings. They're the recommended way to group and bundle test functionality.</Tip>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pwTags" type="string">

The tags to filter which tests to run using Playwright's grep functionality.

Tests matching any of these tags will be executed.

new PlaywrightCheck("critical-e2e-monitor", {
  name: "Critical E2E Monitor",
  playwrightConfigPath: "../playwright.config.ts",
  pwTags: ["@smoke", "@critical"],
