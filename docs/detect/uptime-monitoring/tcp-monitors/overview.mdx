## What are TCP Monitors?

TCP monitors perform low-level connectivity checks by establishing TCP connections to your services. They verify that your services are listening on the expected ports and can accept connections, making them essential for monitoring infrastructure components and backend services.

**TCP Monitors are perfect for detecting downtime and performance issues in:**
- Database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Mail servers (SMTP, IMAP, POP3)
- Custom TCP services and APIs
- Load balancers and proxies
- SSH and FTP servers
- Redis and Memcached instances

## How TCP Monitoring Works

TCP monitors perform connection-level checks:

1. **Connection Attempt** - Establishes a TCP connection to your service
2. **Port Verification** - Confirms the service is listening on the specified port
3. **Response Validation** - Optionally validates service responses
4. **SSL/TLS Check** - Verifies certificate validity for secure connections
5. **Timing Measurement** - Records connection and response times

<Tip>
TCP monitors are ideal for monitoring services that don't expose HTTP endpoints but need connectivity verification.
</Tip>

## SSL/TLS Certificate Monitoring

For services using SSL/TLS, TCP monitors automatically check:

- **Certificate Validity**: Ensures certificates are not expired
- **Chain Validation**: Verifies the complete certificate chain
- **Expiration Warnings**: Alerts before certificates expire
- **Protocol Compliance**: Checks for secure protocol versions

<Warning>
Certificate monitoring is only available when using SSL/TLS protocol options.
</Warning>

## Locations

TCP monitors can run from multiple global locations to ensure your services are accessible worldwide. See [monitoring locations](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/locations) for detailed configuration guidance:


## Metrics

TCP monitors track several timing metrics. Once your TCP monitor is running, you'll see:


- **Connection Time**: Time to establish the TCP connection
- **First Byte Time**: Time to receive first response byte
- **Total Response Time**: Complete request/response cycle
- **DNS Resolution Time**: Time to resolve the hostname
- **SSL Handshake Time**: Certificate validation time (if applicable)


## Alerting 

Configure alerts for various metric conditions. See [alerting configuration](/docs/detect/uptime-monitoring/alerting) for comprehensive setup guidance:
- **Connection Failures**: When the service doesn't accept connections
- **Timeout Exceeded**: When responses take too long
- **Response Validation**: When expected responses don't match
- **Certificate Issues**: When SSL certificates are invalid or expiring



## Best Practices

### Configuration
- Use descriptive monitor names that identify the service and environment
- Set realistic timeout values based on service performance
- Enable SSL certificate monitoring for all encrypted connections
- Monitor from locations relevant to your user base

### Monitoring Strategy
- Start with basic connectivity, add response validation as needed
- Use different monitoring frequencies based on service criticality
- Combine TCP monitors with application-level checks for comprehensive coverage

### Alerting
- Configure multiple alert channels for redundancy
- Set up escalation rules for critical services
- Test alert configurations regularly
- Use maintenance windows during planned downtime


## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Connection Refused">
**Symptom**: Monitor shows "Connection refused" errors
**Causes**:
- Service is not running
- Port is blocked by firewall
- Incorrect host/port configuration


**Solutions**:
1. Verify service is running: `netstat -tlnp | grep :3306`
2. Check firewall rules
3. Test connectivity: `telnet hostname port`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Timeout Errors">
**Symptom**: Monitor times out without connecting
**Causes**:
- Network latency or packet loss
- Service overloaded
- Timeout set too low

**Solutions**:
1. Increase connection timeout
2. Check network connectivity
3. Monitor service performance

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SSL Certificate Issues">
**Symptom**: SSL validation failures
**Causes**:
- Certificate expired
- Hostname mismatch
- Invalid certificate chain

**Solutions**:
1. Check certificate validity: `openssl s_client -connect hostname:port`
2. Verify certificate expiration dates
3. Update certificates before expiration
