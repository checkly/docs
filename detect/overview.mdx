## How Checkly Works

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Monitors to your project">
Start with the monitoring approach that best fits your immediate needs:
- Create them inside the Checkly UI 
- Create them in your repository as [constructs](/constructs)
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Locations, Frequency, and Alerting">
Once Checks are created, you configure where you want to run them, how often they should run, and how you want to be alerted when they fail.
</Step>

<Step title="Run As Tests in CI/CD">
Run them as tests in your CI/CD pipeline. This ensures they are run in production like any other test.
- `npx checkly test` Runs all of your local checks in your project
- `npx checkly trigger` Runs all of your active checks in your account
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy Your Checks For Production Monitoring">
Once you are happy with your monitoring, you can deploy them to production.
- `npx checkly deploy` Deploys all of your checks to production
- Or just save your checks in the UI and they will start to run
</Step>
</Steps>
