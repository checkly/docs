**Monitoring as Code (MaC)** treats monitoring configurations like any other code artifactversion controlled, reviewed, tested, and deployed through automated pipelines.

With MaC, you can define, version, and maintain your monitoring infrastructure alongside your application code, reusing existing tests, code, data, and other assets to create a consistent, automated, and scalable monitoring setup.



<Tip>
To get started with Monitoring as Code, see our [Constructs](/constructs/overview) section or [CLI](/cli/overview) section.

## Core Principles of Monitoring as Code

**Declarative Configuration**: Define your monitors, alerts, and status pages, and more in code files using structured formats (JSON, YAML, TypeScript).

**Version Control**: Store monitoring configs in Git alongside application code to maintain consistency and enable collaboration.

**Infrastructure Automation**: Deploy monitoring changes through CI/CD pipelines with the same rigor as application deployments.



## Benefits of Monitoring as Code

- **Consistency**: Standardized monitoring across environments and teams
- **Collaboration**: Code reviews ensure monitoring best practices
- **Reliability**: Automated deployments reduce manual errors
- **Auditability**: Full change history and rollback capabilities
- **Scalability**: Template-based monitor creation for similar services
- **AI Native**: Use any LLM tooling to generate monitoring code, review code, and more.

## Implementation with Checkly

Checkly supports monitoring as code through multiple approaches:

- **[CLI](/cli/overview)**: Write checks in TypeScript/JavaScript and deploy via `checkly deploy`
- **[Terraform Provider](/docs/integrations/iac/terraform/overview)**: Manage Checkly resources in your infrastructure code
- **[Pulumi Integration](/docs/integrations/iac/pulumi/overview)**: Define monitoring using modern IaC patterns
- **[API](/api/authentication)**: Programmatically manage checks in custom automation

This approach ensures your monitoring evolves with your applications, maintaining accuracy and reducing maintenance overhead.
