Checkly Traces use OpenTelemetry to correlate synthetic check results with your application's backend traces. The diagram below shows how the dataflows connect to Checkly's monitoring and alerting pipeline.

## The Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Automatic Instrumentation">
When enabling the integration, Checkly automatically instruments all HTTP requests made by your checks with `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers. These HTTP requests hit your web application and/or API when running checks.

All synthetic check types, including API, Browser and Multistep checks, include these headers:

- **traceparent**: W3C compliant trace ID generated for each HTTP request that is part of a check. For Browser checks and Multistep checks, there can be multiple requests instrumented.
- **tracestate**: Set to `checkly=true` to identify Checkly as the vendor that generated the trace

Together, these headers propagate the trace context along the request chain. This is the most basic way of tying a synthetic check to your backend traces, though it won't provide much context about the check run itself, like the check name or location.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Result Export">
You can configure your 3rd party backend in the Checkly UI so we can export every check result as a span to your backend. This correlates all backend spans with the check run that triggered them, together with full context of the check run.

Check details are stored in the `checkly` namespace as attributes on the span:

```yaml
checkly.check.name: "ACME homepage"
checkly.check.id: "438481ea-0eab-43d6-8932-ab51bd0d49d6"
checkly.check.type: "browser"
checkly.check.location: "eu-west-1"
```

This provides rich context about the run location, check name, check type, and more.
</Step>

<Step title="Direct Trace Ingestion">
**No 3rd party backend needed.** This is what kicks Checkly's OpenTelemetry integration into high gear, and it works even if you don't have a 3rd party OTel backend already set up.

By adding the correct OTel libraries and simple filter statements, you can send ONLY the traces related to your Checkly checks back to Checkly:

- **Endpoint**: `otel.eu-west-1.checklyhq.com/v1/traces`
- **Filter**: Only traces marked `tracestate: checkly=true`
- **Result**: Traces appear in Checkly UI alongside check results

Checkly's trace ingestion endpoint is a standard OTel backend endpoint that only accepts traces related to synthetic checks. This keeps your OpenTelemetry setup lean while providing full trace correlation benefits.
</Step>

<Step title="Alert Integration">
When your check breaks, you get an alert that points to a check result containing a full trace of the check run, including all backend spans:

- Complete trace of the check run
- All backend spans included
- Quick root cause identification
- No need to jump between tools or dashboards

This allows you to quickly identify issues without switching between different monitoring tools.
</Step>
</Steps>


<Note>
Steps 3 and 4 provide the most value - complete trace visibility without requiring a 3rd party OpenTelemetry backend.
