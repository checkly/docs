## Full release history

<Update label="v1.4.0" tags={["February 2026"]}>
**Added**

- **Secret scrubbing** - Automatically scrub sensitive values from reports and trace files. Configure via the new `scrubbing` option:
  - `envVars`: Array of environment variable names whose values should be scrubbed
  - `autoDetect`: Auto-detect secrets from env vars matching common patterns (SECRET, KEY, TOKEN, PASSWORD, CREDENTIAL, AUTH, PRIVATE, API)
  - `replacement`: Custom replacement string (default: `*********`)
  - Set `scrubbing: false` to disable scrubbing entirely

```typescript
createChecklyReporter({
  scrubbing: {
    envVars: ['API_KEY', 'DB_PASSWORD'],
    autoDetect: true,
    replacement: '[REDACTED]'
  }
})
```

- **Improved network and console data** - Network requests now include detailed fields (domain, resource type, headers, timing, transfer/resource bytes). Console logs include location information. Resource types are automatically derived from Content-Type headers when not available.

**Changed**

- **Playwright 1.58 support** - Now tested against Playwright 1.58.0.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.3.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
**Added**

- **Real-time test progress** - See test results as they run with status icons, error details, and a summary, similar to Playwright's built-in `line` reporter. Disable with `showProgress: false` if using another reporter.

- **Summary table** - View a per-project breakdown of test results with pass/fail/flaky/skip counts and pass rates. Enable with `showSummaryTable: true`. Projects are color-coded for easy identification.

- **Automatic git detection** - Git information (branch, commit, author) is now automatically detected in CI environments and locally.

- **Test step code snippets** - Test steps now include source code context in the report. When viewing step details, you'll see the exact line of code that executed along with surrounding context and a pointer to the precise column location. This makes debugging failed steps easier by showing exactly what code ran.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.2.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
**Breaking Changes**

- **Credentials now required** - The reporter now requires Checkly credentials (`apiKey` + `accountId`) or explicit `dryRun: true`. Previously, missing credentials would silently skip uploading. Now you'll get a clear error message explaining what's needed.

**If you're not using Checkly Test Sessions**, add `dryRun: true` to your config:

```typescript
reporter: [['@checkly/playwright-reporter', { dryRun: true }]]
```

**Added**

- Clear error messages for credential issues:
  - Shows both the config option and environment variable (e.g., "apiKey / CHECKLY_API_KEY")
  - Includes a direct link to the API keys settings page
  - Invalid API keys show "Authentication failed" instead of a generic error
  - Wrong account IDs show "Access denied" with guidance to check the account ID
</Update>

<Update label="v1.1.0" tags={["January 2026"]}>
> **Note:** This minor version contains breaking changes. Due to options API configurations in 1.0.x that could lead to broken states, we decided to publish this as a minor version and unpublish previous 1.0.x releases to prevent issues. If you were using 1.0.x, please update your configuration as described below.

**Breaking Changes**

- **Removed deprecated options** - The following options are no longer supported and will throw an error if used:
  - `outputFile` - Use `outputDir` instead
  - `testResultsDir` - Use `outputDir` instead
  - `outputPath` - Use `outputDir` instead

**Changed**

- **Simplified options API** - The reporter now has a cleaner configuration:
  - `outputDir` - Directory for all output (JSON report and ZIP assets)
  - `verbose` - Enable debug logging
  - `apiKey` - Checkly API key (or use `CHECKLY_API_KEY` env var)
  - `accountId` - Checkly account ID (or use `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` env var)
  - `sessionName` - Custom session name (string or function)
  - `dryRun` - Generate report without uploading
- Reduced package size

**Migration from 1.0.x**

If you were using any deprecated options, update your configuration:

```diff
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
-   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {
-     outputFile: 'results/report.json',
-     testResultsDir: 'test-results',
-   }],
+   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', {
+     outputDir: 'results'
+   }],
  ],
})
```
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.4" tags={["January 2026"]}>
**Fixed**

- Fixed module loading issues in certain Playwright configurations.
- Reduced package size.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.3" tags={["January 2026"]}>
**Fixed**

- Fixed compatibility with Playwright's TypeScript configuration loading mechanism.
- Reporter version now correctly displays in test session summary.
- `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` environment variable is now properly read for all features.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.2" tags={["January 2026"]}>
**Added**

- Anonymous telemetry to understand reporter usage patterns. Disable with `telemetry: false` option.

**Fixed**

- Test session creation is now properly awaited before uploading results, fixing intermittent upload failures in CI environments.
- Sharded test execution now works correctly when using `playwright merge-reports` command.
- Default projects now preserve their empty name correctly.

**Changed**

- Output types now re-export from `@playwright/test/reporter` with Checkly augmentations for `_checkly` property.
</Update>

<Update label="v1.0.0" tags={["January 2025"]}>
First stable release of the rewritten Playwright reporter with extension-based architecture.

**Added**

- **Extension-based architecture** - Modular design allows for composable functionality
- **Broad Playwright support** - Compatible with Playwright versions 1.40 through 1.57+
- **Drop-in JSON replacement** - Fully compatible with Playwright's native JSON reporter output format
- **Trace extraction** - Automatically extracts console messages and network requests from Playwright trace files
- **Checkly integration** - Automatic upload to Checkly Test Sessions when credentials are configured
- **New `createChecklyReporter()` function** - Better intellisense support in `playwright.config.ts`
- **Unified `outputDir` option** - Single option for all output files (JSON report, ZIP assets)
- **Verbose logging** - Debug mode for troubleshooting report generation

**Changed**

- `outputFile` option is deprecated - use `outputDir` instead (JSON written to `{outputDir}/checkly-report.json`)
- `testResultsDir` option is deprecated - use `outputDir` instead
- `outputPath` option is deprecated - ZIP written to `{outputDir}/checkly-report.zip`

**Migration from 0.x**

```diff
// playwright.config.ts
+import { createChecklyReporter } from '@checkly/playwright-reporter'

export default defineConfig({
  reporter: [
-   ['@checkly/playwright-reporter', { outputFile: 'results/report.json' }],
+   createChecklyReporter({ outputDir: 'results' }),
  ],
})
```

The legacy 0.x reporter remains available via `npm install @checkly/playwright-reporter@legacy`.
</Update>
