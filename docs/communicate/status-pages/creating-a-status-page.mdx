### Service Creation and Management

Create services that align with how your users think about your application:

```yaml
# Good service examples
Frontend Application:
  - Website loading and navigation
  - User interface responsiveness
  - Client-side functionality

API Services:
  - Core API endpoints
  - Authentication services
  - Data processing capabilities

Third-party Integrations:
  - Payment processors
  - Email delivery services
  - External data sources
```

<Tip>
Create services from your users' perspective, not your internal architecture. Users care about "Login" working, not whether your "Auth microservice cluster" is healthy.
