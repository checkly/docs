## What are Multistep Checks?

Multistep checks are API-focused tests that perform multiple sequential HTTP requests within a single check. They're designed to test complete user workflows that span multiple API endpoints, ensuring that complex business processes work correctly from start to finish.

**Multistep checks are perfect for:**
- User authentication and authorization flows
- E-commerce checkout and payment processes
- Data processing and workflow pipelines
- Multi-step form submissions
- Complex business transaction testing
- API dependency chain validation

- Data passing between requests
- Complex authentication flows
- Workflow state validation
- Performance measurement across steps

## How Multistep Checks Work

Multistep checks execute a series of API requests in sequence, with the ability to pass data between steps:

1. **Step Execution** - Runs each API request in defined order
2. **Data Flow** - Passes response data from one step to the next
3. **State Validation** - Verifies system state at each step
4. **Error Handling** - Manages failures and rollback scenarios
5. **Performance Tracking** - Measures timing across the entire workflow
6. **Result Aggregation** - Combines results from all steps

<Tip>
Multistep checks are powered by Playwright's API testing mode, providing excellent debugging capabilities and detailed request/response logging.
