Before you can use the Checkly CLI, you need to authenticate with your Checkly account.

## Login Process

The primary way to authenticate is using the interactive login command:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly login
```

This command will:
- Open your default browser to the Checkly authentication page
- Prompt you to log in to your Checkly account
- Generate an API key that the CLI will use for authentication
- Store the credentials securely on your local machine

## Authentication Options

### Environment Variables

You can also authenticate using environment variables, which is useful for CI/CD pipelines and automated environments:

```bash Terminal
# Set your Checkly API key
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Set your Checkly account ID (optional, CLI will detect automatically)
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id_here
```

### API Key Management

To get your API key:

1. Log in to your Checkly dashboard
2. Navigate to **Account Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Create a new API key or copy an existing one
4. Use the key in your environment variables or CLI configuration

## Verifying Authentication

To verify you're properly authenticated:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly whoami
```

This will display your account information and confirm your authentication status.

## Logging Out

To log out and clear your stored credentials:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly logout
```

This will remove the stored API key from your local machine.

## Multiple Accounts

If you work with multiple Checkly accounts, you can switch between them:

```bash Terminal    
# Switch to a different account
npx checkly switch --account-id your_account_id

# View current account
npx checkly whoami
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys** to version control
- **Use environment variables** in production environments
- **Rotate API keys** regularly for security
- **Use least privilege** - create API keys with minimal required permissions
- **Monitor API key usage** in your Checkly dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed" error:**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check that your account ID is correct (if specified)
- Ensure your API key hasn't expired

**"Browser didn't open" error:**
- Manually navigate to the authentication URL shown in the terminal
- Copy and paste the URL into your browser

**"Permission denied" error:**
- Verify your API key has the necessary permissions
- Check if your account has the required features enabled
