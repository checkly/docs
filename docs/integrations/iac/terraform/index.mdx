The [Checkly Terraform provider](https://github.com/checkly/terraform-provider-checkly) enables you to declare your monitoring setup as code using [HashiCorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). You can get started with it in a matter of minutes by following the steps shown below.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš€">
This integration allows you to manage your entire Checkly monitoring infrastructure as code, providing version control, collaboration, and automated deployments for your monitoring setup.
</Callout>

## What is the Checkly Terraform Provider?

The Checkly Terraform provider is an official integration that allows you to define and manage your Checkly monitoring resources using Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach. This enables you to:

## Quick Start

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Terraform">
Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) and create your project directory
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Provider">
Create your `main.tf` file and configure the Checkly provider
</Step>

<Step title="Set Credentials">
Configure your Checkly API key and account ID as environment variables
</Step>

<Step title="Initialize Project">
Run `terraform init` to install the provider and initialize your project
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy Resources">
Run `terraform apply` to deploy your monitoring infrastructure
</Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- **Terraform CLI** installed (version 0.13 or higher)
- **Checkly account** with API access
- **API key** from your Checkly user settings
- **Account ID** from your Checkly account settings

## Installation

### 1. Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir terraform-checkly-getting-started && cd $_ && touch main.tf
```

### 2. Configure Provider

Add the following to your `main.tf`:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    checkly = {
      source = "checkly/checkly"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

variable "checkly_api_key" {}
variable "checkly_account_id" {}

provider "checkly" {
  api_key = var.checkly_api_key
  account_id = var.checkly_account_id
}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set up your Checkly credentials as environment variables:

1. Get your User API key from the [API keys tab](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/user/api-keys) in your user settings
2. Get your Account ID from your [account settings](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/general)

```bash
export TF_VAR_checkly_api_key=cu_xxx
export TF_VAR_checkly_account_id=xxx
```

### Initialize Project

Run `terraform init` to install the Checkly Terraform provider:

```bash
terraform init
```

## Basic Examples

### Browser Check

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Terraform">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "browser-check-1" {
  name                      = "Example Browser Check"
  type                      = "BROWSER"
  activated                 = true
  frequency                 = 5
  
  locations = [
    "eu-central-1",
    "us-west-1"
  ]

  retry_strategy = {
    type = "LINEAR"
  }

  script = <<EOT
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');

test('Has "Playwright" in the page title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});
EOT
}
```
</Tab>

### API Check

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Terraform">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "api-check-1" {
  name                      = "Example API Check"
  type                      = "API"
  activated                 = true
  frequency                 = 1

  locations = [
    "us-west-1",
    "eu-central-1"
  ]

  request {
    url              = "https://api.example.com/"
    follow_redirects = true
    skip_ssl         = false
    assertion {
      source     = "STATUS_CODE"
      comparison = "EQUALS"
      target     = "200"
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Alert Channel

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Terraform">
```terraform
resource "checkly_alert_channel" "email_ac" {
  email {
    address = "jane.doe@email.com"
  }
  send_recovery = true
  send_failure = true
  send_degraded = false
}

resource "checkly_check" "browser-check-1" {
  # ... other configuration

  alert_channel_subscription {
    channel_id = checkly_alert_channel.email_ac.id
    activated  = true
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deployment

Deploy your monitoring infrastructure:

```bash
terraform apply
```

<Warning>
Checkly resources should be managed _either_ through Terraform _or_ through the Checkly UI, not both. Modifying Terraform-managed resources via the UI, and vice-versa, is likely to cause issues.
