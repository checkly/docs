## Overview

The Delete Maintenance Window endpoint permanently removes a maintenance window from your account. This action cannot be undone and will restore normal alerting for all affected checks.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Window Cleanup
- Completed Maintenance
- Schedule Changes

<Warning>
Deleting maintenance windows immediately restores normal alerting for all affected checks. Ensure maintenance activities are complete before deletion.
