  projectName: 'My Project',
  checks: {
    runtimeId: '2025.04',
  }
  /* More options... */
})
```

Or in your runtime-dependent checks:

```typescript apicheck.ts highlight={5}
import { ApiCheck } from 'checkly/constructs'

new ApiCheck('books-api-check-2', {
  name: 'Books API',
  runtimeId: '2025.04',
  /* More options... */
```

Or in your check groups:

```typescript checkgroup.check.ts highlight={5}
import { CheckGroupV2 } from 'checkly/constructs'

const syntheticGroup = new CheckGroupV2('check-group-synthetics', {
  name: 'Synthetic Monitors Group',
  runtimeId: '2025.04',
  /* More options... */
})
```
