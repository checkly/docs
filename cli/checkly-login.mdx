The `checkly login` command authenticates with Checkly by signing up for a new account or logging in to your existing account.

This command opens a browser window or provides a URL for secure OAuth authentication.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before using `checkly login`, ensure you have:

- Checkly CLI installed
- A web browser available (for OAuth authentication)
- Internet connection for authentication flow

No existing Checkly account is required - you can sign up during the login process.
</Accordion>

## Usage

The basic command initiates the login process and authenticates with your Checkly account.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly login
```

<Tip>Use environment variables in environments without interactive prompts. See the [Authentication section](/cli/authentication#other-authentication-options) for more info.</Tip>

## Examples

```bash Terminal
npx checkly login

✔ Do you want to log in or sign up to Checkly? › I want to sign up for a new Checkly account
✔ Do you want to open a browser window to continue with sign up? … yes
✔ Which account do you want to use? › Monitoring as Code

Successfully logged in as raccoon@checklyhq.com.
Welcome to the Checkly CLI.
```

## Authentication Flow

The login process is interactive and will:

1. **Open your default browser** to the Checkly authentication page
2. **Prompt for account selection** if you have multiple accounts
3. **Store authentication tokens** locally for future CLI usage
4. **Display confirmation** with your account information

### New Users

If you don't have a Checkly account:

1. Click "Sign up" on the authentication page
2. Complete account registration
3. Return to the CLI - you'll be automatically logged in

### Existing Users

If you already have an account:

1. Enter your credentials on the authentication page
2. Complete any two-factor authentication if enabled
3. Return to the CLI - authentication will complete automatically

## Authentication Storage

After successful login, the CLI stores authentication tokens locally in:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Preferences/@checkly/cli-nodejs/auth.json`
- **Linux**: ` ~/.config/@checkly/cli-nodejs/auth.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\@checkly\cli-nodejs\auth.json`

These tokens are encrypted and used for subsequent CLI operations without requiring re-authentication.

## Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't open automatically

If the authentication browser window doesn't open:

1. Decline to open a new browser window in the CLI dialog
2. Manually open the displayed URL in your preferred browser
3. Complete authentication and return to the CLI

### Multiple accounts

If you have access to multiple Checkly accounts, you'll be prompted to select which account to use as the active account for CLI operations.

You can also switch accounts later using [`checkly switch`](/cli/checkly-switch).
