## Best Practices

- **Regular exports**: Schedule periodic data exports for long-term trend analysis
- **Filter strategically**: Use tags and groups to create focused reports for different teams
- **Monitor P95/P99**: Don't rely only on averages - percentiles reveal user experience reality
- **Compare periods**: Use date range filtering to compare performance before and after deployments
