description: 'Define, version, and maintain your monitoring infrastructure alongside your application code'

**Monitoring as Code** treats monitoring configurations like any other code artifactversion controlled, reviewed, tested, and deployed through automated pipelines.

## Core Principles

**Declarative Configuration**: Define your monitors, alerts, and dashboards in code files using structured formats (JSON, YAML, TypeScript).

**Version Control Integration**: Store monitoring configs in Git alongside application code to maintain consistency and enable collaboration.

**Infrastructure Automation**: Deploy monitoring changes through CI/CD pipelines with the same rigor as application deployments.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Standardized monitoring across environments and teams
- **Collaboration**: Code reviews ensure monitoring best practices
- **Reliability**: Automated deployments reduce manual errors
- **Auditability**: Full change history and rollback capabilities
- **Scalability**: Template-based monitor creation for similar services

## Implementation with Checkly

Checkly supports monitoring as code through multiple approaches:

- **[CLI](/cli/overview)**: Write checks in TypeScript/JavaScript and deploy via `checkly deploy`
- **[Terraform Provider](/docs/integrations/iac/terraform/overview)**: Manage Checkly resources in your infrastructure code
- **[Pulumi Integration](/docs/integrations/iac/pulumi/overview)**: Define monitoring using modern IaC patterns
- **[API](/api/authentication)**: Programmatically manage checks in custom automation

This approach ensures your monitoring evolves with your applications, maintaining accuracy and reducing maintenance overhead.
