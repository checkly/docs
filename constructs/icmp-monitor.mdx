<Tip>
Learn more about ICMP Monitors in [the ICMP monitor overview](/detect/uptime-monitoring/icmp-monitors/overview).
</Tip>

ICMP monitors check if a host is reachable by sending ICMP Echo Requests (pings). Use them to monitor network connectivity and latency.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before creating ICMP Monitors, ensure you have:

- An initialized Checkly CLI project
- A hostname or IP address you want to ping
- Basic understanding of network connectivity (ICMP / ping)

For additional setup information, see [CLI overview](/cli/overview).
</Accordion>

<CodeGroup>

```ts Basic Example
import { Frequency, IcmpMonitor } from "checkly/constructs"

new IcmpMonitor('icmp-welcome', {
  name: 'Welcome Site Reachability',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
  request: {
    hostname: 'welcome.checklyhq.com',
  },
  degradedPacketLossThreshold: 20, // percentage
  maxPacketLossThreshold: 30, // percentage
})
```

```ts Advanced Example
import { Frequency, IcmpAssertionBuilder, IcmpMonitor } from "checkly/constructs"

new IcmpMonitor('cloudflare-dns-icmp', {
  name: 'Cloudflare DNS ICMP Monitor',
  activated: true,
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
  maxPacketLossThreshold: 20, // percentage
  degradedPacketLossThreshold: 10,
  request: {
    hostname: '1.1.1.1',
    pingCount: 20,
    assertions: [
      IcmpAssertionBuilder.latency('avg').lessThan(100),
      IcmpAssertionBuilder.latency('max').lessThan(200),
    ]
  }
})
```

## Configuration

ICMP monitors have their own ICMP-specific settings, plus the standard monitor options shared across all check types.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="ICMP Monitor Settings">

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `request` | `object` | ✅ | - | ICMP request configuration object |
| `degradedPacketLossThreshold` | `number` | ❌ | `10` | Packet loss percentage at which the monitor is marked as degraded |
| `maxPacketLossThreshold` | `number` | ❌ | `20` | Packet loss percentage at which the monitor is marked as failed |

### `IcmpMonitor` Options

<ResponseField name="request" type="object" required >

ICMP request configuration, including ping settings and response validation.

**Usage:**

```ts
new IcmpMonitor('icmp-monitor', {
  name: 'ICMP Latency Monitor',
  request: {
    hostname: 'api.checklyhq.com',
    pingCount: 15,
    assertions: [
      IcmpAssertionBuilder.latency('avg').lessThan(100),
    ]
  }
})
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `hostname` | `string` | ✅ | - | The target host (domain name or IP address) |
| `pingCount` | `number` | ❌ | `10` | Number of ICMP Echo Request packets to send per check run (1-50, default: 10) |
| `assertions` | `IcmpAssertion[]` | ❌ | `[]` | Response assertions using the `IcmpAssertionBuilder` |
| `ipFamily` | `string` | ❌ | `IPv4` | IP family selection (IPv4, IPv6) |

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="degradedPacketLossThreshold" type="number" default="10">
Packet loss percentage at which the monitor is marked as degraded (warning state).

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new IcmpMonitor("icmp-performance-tiers", {
  name: "ICMP Performance Tiers",
  degradedPacketLossThreshold: 15, // Warn at 15%
  request: {
    hostname: '1.1.1.1',
    pingCount: 20,
  }
})
```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="maxPacketLossThreshold" type="number" default="20">
Packet loss percentage at which the monitor is marked as failed

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new IcmpMonitor("icmp-performance-tiers", {
  name: "ICMP Performance Tiers",
  maxPacketLossThreshold: 25, // Fail at 25%
  request: {
    hostname: '1.1.1.1',
    pingCount: 20,
  }
})
```

</ResponseField>

### `IcmpMonitor` Assertions

Assertions for ICMP monitors can be defined using the `IcmpAssertionBuilder`. The following sources are available:

- `latency(property)`: Validate round-trip time (RTT) for ICMP pings. The property parameter is required and must be one of: `avg`, `min`, `max`, or `stdDev`
- `jsonResponse(property?)`: Assert against the [JSON response structure](/detect/uptime-monitoring/icmp-monitors/configuration#json-response-schemas). This allows you to target specific fields using JSON path assertions

Here are some examples:

- Assert the average latency is below a threshold

```ts
IcmpAssertionBuilder.latency('avg').lessThan(100)
// Equivalent to:
{ source: 'LATENCY', property: 'avg', comparison: 'LESS_THAN', target: '100' }
```

- Assert against specific JSON fields in the response

```ts
IcmpAssertionBuilder.jsonResponse('$.packetsReceived').equals(10)
// Equivalent to:
{ source: 'JSON_RESPONSE', property: '$.packetsReceived', comparison: 'EQUALS', target: '10' }
```

Learn more in our docs on [Assertions](/detect/assertions).

### General Monitor Options

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
Friendly name for your ICMP Monitor that will be displayed in the Checkly dashboard and used in notifications.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={2}
new IcmpMonitor("my-monitor", {
  name: "ICMP Ping Monitor",
  /* More options ... */
})
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="frequency" type="Frequency">
How often the ICMP Monitor should run. Use the `Frequency` enum to set the check interval.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new IcmpMonitor("my-monitor", {
  name: "ICMP Ping Monitor",
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
  /* More options ... */
})
```

**Available frequencies**: `EVERY_10S`, `EVERY_20S`, `EVERY_30S`, `EVERY_1M`, `EVERY_2M`, `EVERY_5M`, `EVERY_10M`, `EVERY_15M`, `EVERY_30M`, `EVERY_1H`, `EVERY_2H`, `EVERY_3H`, `EVERY_6H`, `EVERY_12H`, `EVERY_24H`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="locations" type="string[]" default="[]">
Array of [public location codes](/concepts/locations/#public-locations) where the ICMP Monitor should run from. Multiple locations provide geographic coverage and help detect regional network issues.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new IcmpMonitor("global-icmp-monitor", {
  name: "ICMP Ping Monitor",
  locations: ["us-east-1", "eu-central-1", "ap-southeast-1"]
})
```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="activated" type="boolean" default="true">
Whether the ICMP Monitor is enabled and will run according to its schedule.

**Usage:**

```ts highlight={3}
new IcmpMonitor("my-monitor", {
  name: "ICMP Ping Monitor",
  activated: false // Disabled monitor
})
```
