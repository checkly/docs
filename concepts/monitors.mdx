Monitors are Checkly's streamlined **Uptime offering** designed for straightforward, continuous monitoring of your essential services. Each Monitor represents a single, focused monitoring task that runs at a set interval you configure. Monitors are sold individually, making them perfect for teams that need simple, cost-effective uptime monitoring.

Think of Monitors as your dedicated sentries—each one has a specific job and runs independently at its own schedule. They're designed for simplicity and reliability, focusing on the core question: "Is my service up and responding correctly?"

## Types of Monitors

Checkly offers three types of Monitors, each optimized for different monitoring scenarios:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="URL Monitors">
Monitor HTTP/HTTPS endpoints for availability and basic performance. URL Monitors check if your websites and APIs are responding correctly by making HTTP requests and validating the response.

**Perfect for:**
- Website uptime monitoring
- API endpoint availability
- Basic performance tracking
- SSL certificate monitoring
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="TCP Monitors">
Verify connectivity to any TCP service by establishing connections to specific hosts and ports. TCP Monitors test the availability of non-HTTP services and infrastructure components.

**Perfect for:**
- Database connectivity
- Custom application services
- Network service availability
- Port accessibility testing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Heartbeat Monitors">
Monitor scheduled processes, cron jobs, and batch operations that should "check in" at regular intervals. Instead of actively testing your service, Heartbeat Monitors wait to receive a signal from your system.

**Perfect for:**
- Backup job verification
- Scheduled task monitoring
- Batch process oversight
- Data pipeline health
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## How Monitors Work

Each Monitor operates independently with its own configuration:

- **Individual Scheduling**: Set each Monitor to run at intervals that make sense for that specific service (every 1 minute, 5 minutes, 30 minutes, etc.)
- **Simple Configuration**: Straightforward setup focused on the essentials—URL, expected response, timeout settings
- **Dedicated Alerting**: Each Monitor can have its own alert rules and notification channels
- **Pay-per-Monitor**: Pricing scales linearly with the number of Monitors you need

## Monitors vs Checks

Monitors are part of Checkly's **Uptime offering**—they're designed for teams who need reliable, no-frills monitoring with predictable costs. Each Monitor focuses on one specific task and runs independently.

If you need more sophisticated testing capabilities like multi-step workflows, complex browser automation, or advanced scripting, you'll want to explore [Checks](/docs/concepts/checks)—our flexible monitoring solution that includes Browser Checks, Multistep Checks, and advanced API testing.

## When to Choose Monitors

Monitors are ideal when you need:

- **Simple uptime monitoring** for websites and APIs
- **Predictable costs** with per-monitor pricing
- **Independent scheduling** for different services
- **Straightforward setup** without complex scripting
- **Basic alerting** when services go down or perform poorly

Monitors provide the reliability and simplicity that many teams need for essential uptime monitoring, while Checks offer the flexibility and advanced capabilities for comprehensive end-to-end testing scenarios.
