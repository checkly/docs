## Overview

The Trigger Check Execution endpoint allows you to manually execute a specific check outside of its scheduled runs. This is useful for on-demand testing, debugging, and immediate validation.

**Common Use Cases**:
- Manual Testing
- Deployment Validation
- Debugging Issues
- Immediate Health Checks

<Note>
Manually triggered checks execute immediately and results are recorded alongside scheduled runs. Triggered executions count toward your account's check execution limits.
