To set up a Status Page, select ‘New status page’ on the [Status page overview](https://app.checklyhq.com/status-pages).

1. Begin by entering a name for your page.
2. Next, fill in the first **card**'s title and add services to it. Cards enable grouping **services** on your page and will show the average uptime for all the services listed on the card.
3. If you haven’t already created any service yet, you can do so from the `Services` dropdown by typing a name and clicking `Create`. See [Services](/communicate/status-pages/overview#services) for more details.
4. Customize the subdomain for your page. By default status pages will use the domain `.checkly-status-pages.com` but you can also use your own domain. See [Custom domains](/communicate/status-pages/customization#custom-domains) for more details.
5. When you are happy with your setup, click ‘Create status page.’ You will now see a preview of your page, and a link to the public version of the page below the title.

You can now share the link to your Status Page, and your users can subscribe to receive notifications when incidents are posted!
