You can define a new group, or associate a Playwright Check Suite to an existing group.

## Steps

### 1. Create a group for your checks

Create a new file to create and configure your new group.

```typescript website-group.check.ts
import { CheckGroup } from 'checkly/constructs'

export const myGroup = new CheckGroup('production-group', {
  name: 'Production group',
  logicalID: 'production-group',
  activated: true,
  muted: false,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['mac', 'group'],
  environmentVariables: [],
  apiCheckDefaults: {},
  concurrency: 100,
  runParallel: true,
  retryStrategy: RetryStrategyBuilder.linearStrategy({
    baseBackoffSeconds: 30,
    maxRetries: 2,
    sameRegion: false
  }),
})
```

### 2. Associate the group to the check

When specifying your Playwright Check Suite, you can reference the new or existing group, using its name:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={13}
export default defineConfig({
  logicalId: 'checkly-website',
  projectName: 'checkly-website',
  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: './playwright.config.ts',
    playwrightChecks: [
      {
        name: 'Critical Tests',
        logicalId: 'critical-tests',
        pwTags:'critical',
        frequency: 10,
        locations: ['us-east-1',],
        groupName: 'Production group', // use the name of the group you created
      },
    ],
  },
})

export default config
```

### 3. Deploy to apply the changes

```bash
npx checkly deploy --preview # confirm what will be deployed
npx checkly deploy           # deploy
```

You can now see your Playwright Check Suite assigned to your group.
