## Overview

Retrieves a check session. The response may be incomplete if the session is still in progress.

Results for all finished check runs are included, with one result per run location. Each result contains enough data to quickly determine success or failure.

For detailed information on a specific result, use the `GET /v1/check-results/{checkId}/{checkResultId}` endpoint.
