## What are ICMP Monitors?

ICMP monitors verify that a host is reachable and responding. Typical use cases include:

* Detecting network-level outages before they're visible via HTTP endpoints
* Monitoring latency across regions to identify geographic performance issues
* Verifying reachability for servers, load balancers, or network appliances that don't expose HTTP endpoints or open TCP ports
* Tracking packet loss to catch network quality degradation early

## How do ICMP monitors work?

ICMP monitors perform ping tests:

* Hostname resolution: If a hostname is provided, Checkly resolves it to an IP address.
* Ping execution: Multiple ICMP Echo Request packets (configurable from 1–50, default: 10) are sent from your configured location(s).
* Response valildation: ICMP Echo Reply packets are received. Round-trip latency and packet loss are measured and evaluated against your configured assertions.

For example, pinging checklyhq.com with 10 pings returns:

```json
{
  "latency": {
    "min": 12.3,
    "max": 18.7,
    "avg": 14.2,
    "stddev": 2.1
  },
  "packetLoss": 0,
  "timingPhases": { "dns": 5.2 },
  "pingsSucceeded": 10,
  "pingsFailed": 0
}
```

The response appears on the results page as both raw output and parsed JSON. You can use it as a reference to define [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/icmp-monitors/configuration#assertions) for expected values.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="100% packet loss but the host is reachable via HTTP">
**Symptom**: ICMP monitor shows complete packet loss, but the website/API works fine

**Root cause**:
- **Firewall rules blocking ICMP**: Many organizations block ICMP echo request packets at the firewall, load balancer, or host level as a security measure

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Verify HTTP connectivity**: Create an API or URL monitor for the same hostname to confirm it's reachable
2. **Check both protocols**: Test both IPv4 and IPv6, some hosts allow ICMP on one protocol but not the other
3. **Confirm with infrastructure team**: Ask if ICMP is intentionally blocked in security policies

**When to use a different monitor type**: If ICMP is deliberately blocked, use TCP, URL, or API checks instead to verify availability at the application layer.

<Accordion title="High latency or packet loss from specific regions">
**Symptom**: ICMP monitor shows high latency or packet loss from certain locations but not others

**Root causes**:
- **Geographic routing**: Network paths vary by region, some routes may be congested
- **Transit provider issues**: Problems with specific ISPs or peering connections
- **Rate limiting**: Some hosts rate-limit ICMP responses, affecting distant locations more

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Compare across locations**: Run monitors from multiple regions to identify which paths are affected
2. **Monitor trends over time**: Check if issues are persistent or intermittent
3. **Cross-reference with other monitor types**: Compare ICMP latency with TCP/HTTP latency from the same locations
4. **Use latency assertions**: Set region-specific assertions, e.g., `latency.avg` less than `50ms` for nearby regions, `200ms` for distant ones

**Investigation tip**: Persistent high latency from a specific region often indicates routing issues with your hosting provider or CDN configuration.
