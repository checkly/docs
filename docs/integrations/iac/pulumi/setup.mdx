This guide walks you through the complete setup process for using Pulumi with Checkly, from initial installation to your first deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **Git** for version control
- **Checkly account** with API access
- **Pulumi account** (free tier available)

## Step 1: Install Pulumi CLI

<Steps>
<Step title="Choose Installation Method">
Select your preferred installation method based on your operating system and package manager
</Step>

<Step title="Install Pulumi">
Run the appropriate installation command for your system
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Installation">
Confirm Pulumi CLI is working correctly
</Step>
</Steps>

### Installation Options

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install -g @pulumi/pulumi
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add @pulumi/pulumi
```

```bash brew
brew install pulumi/tap/pulumi
```

```bash curl
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh
```
</CodeGroup>

### Verify Installation

```bash
pulumi version
```

You should see output similar to:
```
v3.100.0
```

## Step 2: Pulumi Account Setup

### Create Account

1. Visit [app.pulumi.com/signup](https://app.pulumi.com/signup)
2. Sign up with your preferred method (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
3. Complete the account verification process

### Generate Access Token

1. Navigate to [app.pulumi.com/account/tokens](https://app.pulumi.com/account/tokens)
2. Click "Create token"
3. Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "Checkly Integration")
4. Copy the generated token (you won't be able to see it again)

<Tip>
Store your access token securely. You can use environment variables or a password manager to keep it safe.
</Tip>

### Login to Pulumi

```bash
pulumi login
```

When prompted, paste your access token or press Enter to use browser-based authentication.

Verify your login:

```bash
pulumi whoami
```

## Step 3: Checkly API Configuration

### Get Your Account ID

1. Log into [app.checklyhq.com](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Account** → **General**
3. Copy your **Account ID**

### Create API Key

1. Go to **Settings** → **User** → **API Keys**
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Pulumi Integration")
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `cu_`)

<Warning>
API keys have full access to your Checkly account. Keep them secure and never commit them to version control.
</Warning>

## Step 4: Project Setup

### Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir my-checkly-monitoring && cd my-checkly-monitoring
```

### Initialize Pulumi Project

```bash
pulumi new javascript
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Project name**: `my-checkly-monitoring` (or your preferred name)
- **Project description**: `Checkly monitoring infrastructure as code`
- **Stack name**: `dev` (or your preferred environment name)

### Install Checkly Provider

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @checkly/pulumi
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @checkly/pulumi
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: Configure Authentication

### Option 1: Environment Variables (Recommended for Development)

Add to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
export CHECKLY_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Reload your shell or source the profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Option 2: Pulumi Configuration (Recommended for Teams)

```bash
pulumi config set checkly:apiKey your_api_key --secret
pulumi config set checkly:accountId your_account_id
```

<Tip>
Using Pulumi configuration is better for team environments as it stores settings with your stack and can be shared across team members.
</Tip>

### Verify Configuration

Test that your credentials are accessible:

```bash
echo $CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID
echo $CHECKLY_API_KEY
```

Or check Pulumi config:

```bash
pulumi config
```

## Step 6: Create Your First Check

### Update index.js

Replace the contents of `index.js` with:

```javascript
const checkly = require('@checkly/pulumi')

// Create a simple API check
new checkly.Check('hello-world-api', {
  name: 'Hello World API',
  activated: true,
  frequency: 10,
  type: 'API',
  locations: ['eu-west-1'],
  tags: ['pulumi', 'example'],
  request: {
    method: 'GET',
    url: 'https://httpbin.org/status/200',
    assertions: [
      {
        source: 'STATUS_CODE',
        comparison: 'EQUALS',
        target: '200',
      },
    ],
  },
  useGlobalAlertSettings: true,
})
```

## Step 7: Deploy Your Infrastructure

### Preview Changes

```bash
pulumi preview
```

This shows you what resources will be created without making changes.

### Deploy

```bash
pulumi up
```

When prompted, type `yes` to confirm the deployment.

<Callout type="success" emoji="✅">
Congratulations! You've successfully set up Pulumi with Checkly and deployed your first monitoring check.
</Callout>

## Step 8: Verify Deployment

1. Visit your [Checkly dashboard](https://app.checklyhq.com)
2. Navigate to **Checks**
3. You should see your new "Hello World API" check
4. The check should be running and showing as "Passing"
