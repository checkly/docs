This guide walks you through creating your first TCP monitor to check the availability of your network services, databases, or any TCP-based application.

TCP monitors verify the availability of non-HTTP services by establishing a connection to a specific host and port.

<Tip>
**Monitoring as Code**: To get started with your first TCP Monitor using code, learn more about the [TCP Monitor Construct](/constructs/tcp-monitor).
</Tip>

## Basic Setup

Configure your TCP monitor by specifying the target service:

</Frame>

* **Hostname:** The server you want to monitor (e.g. `db.example.com`)
* **Port:** The TCP port your service is listening on (e.g. `3306` for MySQL)
* **IP family:** Defaults to IPv4

## Assertions

Configure connection timeouts and data transmission assertions:

</Frame>

* **Connection timeout:** Maximum time to wait for connection (default: 10 seconds)
* **Read timeout:** Time to wait for response after connection (default: 10 seconds)
* **Data to send:** Optional data to transmit after establishing connection

## Response Validation

Validate the service response for more precise monitoring:

</Frame>

* **Response data:** Expected text pattern in the response
* **Response time limits:** Define performance thresholds for degraded or failed states

## Frequency

Set how often the monitor runs (every 10 seconds to 24 hours):

</Frame>

## Scheduling & Locations

</Frame>

* **Strategy:** Choose between round-robin or parallel execution. Learn more about [scheduling strategies](/monitoring/global-locations#scheduling-strategies)
* **Locations:** Select one or more [public](/monitoring/global-locations/) or [private](/private-locations/) locations to run the monitor from

## Additional Settings

* **Name:** Give your monitor a clear name to identify it in dashboards and alerts
* **Tags:** Use tags to organize monitors across dashboards and [maintenance windows](/maintenance-windows/)
* **Retries:** Define how failed runs should be retried. See [retry strategies](/alerting-and-retries/retries/)
* **Alerting:** Configure your [alert settings](/alerting-and-retries/alert-settings/), [alert channels](/alerting-and-retries/alert-channels/), or set up [webhooks](/alerting-and-retries/webhooks/) for custom integrations


<Note>
TCP monitors provide network-level connectivity verification. For application-level monitoring, consider adding [synthetic monitoring](/detect/synthetic-monitoring/overview) to your monitoring strategy.
