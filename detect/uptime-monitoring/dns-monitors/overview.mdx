## What are DNS Monitors?

DNS monitors check that your DNS records resolve as expected. They help you catch misconfigurations, expired records, or propagation issues before they impact your users.  

**Typical use cases include:**  
- Detecting if your domain stops resolving to its IP address to prevent downtime
- Verifying that records resolve correctly when queried against a specific nameserver (e.g. 8.8.8.8 or dns.google) to catch resolver-specific issues
- Monitoring DNS lookup and response times to detect performance degradation or resolver latency
- Spotting slow or inconsistent DNS resolution across different regions

## How do DNS monitors work?

To verify your DNS configuration, DNS monitors run lookups for the requested record type:

* When you specify a domain, Checkly runs a DNS lookup from the configured location(s)

* The query is sent to a DNS resolver (by default a public DNS server, or a custom one you define)

* The resolver continues through the DNS chain and retrieves the requested record type from the authoritative server

For example, querying the A record for checklyhq.com returns:

```
NOERROR 0ms
;; opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16122
;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;checklyhq.com.	IN	 A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.127
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.76
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.10
checklyhq.com.	6	IN	A	18.66.102.85
```

The query response is shown on the results page in the UI as both raw output and parsed JSON, based on which you can define [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/dns-monitors/configuration#assertions) for expected responses.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues [Placeholder]

This is a placeholder from chatGPT, we should talk to someone like Daniel, Simo or the platform team to nail down a few useful tips

<Accordion title="NXDOMAIN (Non-Existent Domain)">
**Symptom**: The monitor shows `NXDOMAIN`.  
**Causes**:  
- The domain does not exist or has been removed.  
- Typo in the domain name.  
- Record not yet propagated.  

**Solutions**:  
1. Verify the domain spelling.  
2. Check record existence with: `dig example.com`.  
3. Allow time for DNS changes to propagate.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="SERVFAIL">
**Symptom**: The monitor shows `SERVFAIL`.  
**Causes**:  
- Authoritative nameserver unavailable.  
- Misconfigured DNSSEC.  
- Issues with the upstream resolver.  

**Solutions**:  
1. Query a specific resolver: `dig @8.8.8.8 example.com`.  
2. Verify DNSSEC configuration.  
3. Check availability of authoritative nameservers.  
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow Resolution">
**Symptom**: Lookup times exceed thresholds.  
**Causes**:  
- High latency to resolver.  
- Overloaded DNS server.  
- Network issues on intermediate hops.  

**Solutions**:  
1. Compare response times from different locations.  
2. Identify slow or failing resolvers.  
3. Contact your DNS provider if latency persists.
