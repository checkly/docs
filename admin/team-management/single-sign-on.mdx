Single Sign-On (SSO) enables businesses to secure employee access across a variety of third-party services. Currently, Checkly supports the following SSO protocols:

1. [SAML](/admin/team-management/saml)
2. [Microsoft Entra ID](/admin/team-management/microsoft-azure-ad) (formerly Azure AD)

If you are interested in using Checkly with a different SSO protocol, please [reach out to Support](mailto:support@checklyhq.com).

<Note>
SSO is only available for Checkly's [enterprise plans](https://www.checklyhq.com/pricing/).
