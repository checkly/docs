## Overview

Create a new [check group](/platform/groups) to organize related checks and apply shared settings. Check groups help you manage multiple checks efficiently by providing common configuration, environment variables, and alert channels.

<Note>
  You can add checks to a group by setting the `groupId` property of individual checks.
