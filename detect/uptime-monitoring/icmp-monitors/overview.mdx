## What are ICMP Monitors?

ICMP monitors verify that a host is reachable and responding. Typical use cases include:

* Verifying reachability for servers, load balancers, or network appliances that don't expose HTTP endpoints or open TCP ports
* Detecting network-level outages before they're visible via HTTP endpoints
* Monitoring latency across regions to identify geographic performance issues
* Tracking packet loss to catch network quality degradation early

## How do ICMP monitors work?

ICMP monitors perform ping tests:

* Hostname resolution: If a hostname is provided, Checkly resolves it to an IP address
* Ping execution: Multiple ICMP Echo Request packets (configurable from 1–50, default: 10) are sent from your configured location(s)
* Response valildation: ICMP Echo Reply packets are received. Round-trip latency and packet loss are measured and evaluated against your configured assertions

For example, pinging `checklyhq.com` with 3 pings returns:

```json
PING checklyhq.com (18.239.105.69): 56 bytes of data
64 bytes from 18.239.105.69: icmp_seq=0 ttl=247 time=6.6 ms
64 bytes from 18.239.105.69: icmp_seq=1 ttl=247 time=49.8 ms
64 bytes from 18.239.105.69: icmp_seq=2 ttl=247 time=6.6 ms

--- checklyhq.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 6.573/20.993/49.812/24.958 ms
```

The response appears on the results page as both raw output and parsed JSON. You can use it as a reference to define [assertions](/detect/uptime-monitoring/icmp-monitors/configuration#assertions) for expected values.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

<Accordion title="100% packet loss but the host is reachable via HTTP">
**Symptom**: ICMP monitor shows complete packet loss, but the website/API works fine

**Root cause**: 
* Many organizations block ICMP echo request packets at the firewall, load balancer, or host level as a security measure

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Verify HTTP connectivity**: Create an API or URL monitor for the same hostname to confirm it's reachable
2. **Check both protocols**: Test both IPv4 and IPv6, some hosts allow ICMP on one protocol but not the other
3. **Confirm with infrastructure team**: Ask if ICMP is intentionally blocked in security policies

**When to use a different monitor type**: If ICMP is deliberately blocked, use TCP, URL, or API checks instead to verify availability at the application layer
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="High latency or packet loss from specific regions">
**Symptom**: ICMP monitor shows high latency or packet loss from certain locations but not others

**Root causes**:
- **Geographic routing**: Network paths vary by region, some routes may be congested
- **Transit provider issues**: Problems with specific ISPs or peering connections
- **Rate limiting**: Some hosts rate-limit ICMP responses, affecting distant locations more

**How to detect and fix**:
1. **Compare across locations**: Run monitors from multiple regions to identify which paths are affected
2. **Monitor trends over time**: Check if issues are persistent or intermittent
3. **Cross-reference with other monitor types**: Compare ICMP latency with TCP/HTTP latency from the same locations
4. **Use latency assertions**: Set region-specific assertions, e.g., `latency.avg` less than `50ms` for nearby regions, `200ms` for distant ones

**Investigation tip**: Persistent high latency from a specific region often indicates routing issues with your hosting provider or CDN configuration
