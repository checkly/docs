## What are Playwright Check Suites?

Playwright Check Suites enable you to run entire Playwright suites and projects as both pre-production tests and global production monitors, without any code rewrites.

Unlike [Browser Checks](/docs/browser-checks), Playwright Check Suites are not limited to a single test spec running in an async browser session. You can run Playwright projects with complete with dependencies, private packages, storage, and more. It's a complete native way to run Playwright in production.

Playwright Check Suites support for the full Playwright API and ecosystem, meaning you can use your existing tests and `playwright.config.ts` files as is.

<Note>
Playwright Check Suites are currently in Beta. Join the [Slack community](https://checklycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2qc51mpyr-5idwVD4R4izkf5FC4CFk1A#/shared-invite/email) to get live updates on feature development and get help getting started.
</Note>

**Playwright Check Suites are perfect for:**
- Converting existing E2E tests into monitoring
- Testing complex user workflows across multiple browsers
- Monitoring critical business processes
- Validating application functionality after deployments

## How It Works

Playwright Check Suites integrate seamlessly with your existing test projects through:

1. **Test Discovery** - Analyzes your Playwright configuration and test files
2. **Selective Monitoring** - Uses tags and projects to define monitoring scope
3. **Global Deployment** - Runs tests from multiple worldwide locations
4. **Continuous Monitoring** - Executes on schedules with performance tracking
5. **Alert Integration** - Notifies teams when tests fail or performance degrades

<Info>
**Runtime Limits**: During Beta, Playwright Check Suites can run up to 20 minutes per execution. This limit can be adjusted based on feedback.

## Test Selection

Control which tests become monitoring checks using:

- **Tags**: Select tests marked with specific tags (e.g., `@critical`, `@smoke`)
- **Projects**: Choose browser configurations from your Playwright config
- **Combinations**: Mix tags and projects for precise test selection

```typescript
// Example: Monitor critical tests in Chromium
{
  name: 'Critical User Flows',
  pwTags: '@critical',
  pwProjects: 'chromium',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
}
```

## Monitoring Configuration

Customize monitoring behavior with:

- **Frequency**: From every minute to custom schedules
- **Locations**: Choose from global monitoring regions
- **Alerting**: Configure team notifications and escalation
- **Groups**: Organize related checks for management
- **Dependencies**: Support for private packages and custom registries
