Checkly provides sophisticated alerting and retry mechanisms to keep you informed when your checks change state—whether they fail, show degraded performance, or recover. Smart configuration helps you avoid alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues reach the right people at the right time.

## What is Checkly Alerting?

Checkly alerts you when your checks transition between states such as passing to failing, degraded performance, or recovery. The system is designed to provide actionable notifications while minimizing noise through intelligent retry strategies and flexible escalation policies.

## Core Alerting Components

### 1. Alert Settings
Control **when** and **how often** you receive notifications with threshold alerting:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Escalation strategies" icon="stairs">
- **Run-based**: Alert after consecutive failures
- **Time-based**: Alert if failing for specific duration
- **Location threshold**: Only alert when % of locations fail
- **Immediate**: Alert on first failure
</Card>

<Card title="Reminder configuration" icon="clock">
- Multiple reminder intervals

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Retry Mechanisms
Reduce false positives and alert noise with intelligent retry strategies:

```typescript
// Example retry configuration
const retryConfig = {
  strategy: "exponential", // fixed, linear, exponential
  maxRetries: 3,
  initialInterval: 5, // seconds
  maxDuration: 300, // 5 minutes maximum
  sameLocation: false // retry from different location
}
```

## Alert States and Transitions

Understanding how Checkly tracks check states helps you configure appropriate alerting:

<Steps>
<Step title="Check Execution">
Your check runs according to its schedule from configured locations
</Step>

<Step title="State Evaluation">
Checkly evaluates the check result against performance thresholds and assertions
</Step>

<Step title="State Transition">
If the check state changes (pass → fail, fail → pass, normal → degraded), the alert system activates
</Step>

<Step title="Retry Logic">
If configured, failed checks are automatically retried according to your retry strategy
</Step>

<Step title="Alert Escalation">
If retries don't resolve the issue, alerts are sent based on your escalation settings
</Step>

<Step title="Recovery Notification">
When checks recover, recovery alerts are sent according to your notification preferences
</Step>
</Steps>

### Alert Types and States

| Alert Type | Description | When Triggered |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| `ALERT_FAILURE` | Check hard failure | Check encounters error or assertion failure |
| `ALERT_DEGRADED` | Performance degradation | Check succeeds but exceeds response time thresholds |
| `ALERT_RECOVERY` | Service recovery | Failed or degraded check returns to passing state |
| `ALERT_DEGRADED_RECOVERY` | Performance improvement | Degraded check returns to normal performance |
| `ALERT_SSL` | SSL certificate expiration | Certificate expires within warning threshold |

## Comprehensive Alert Configuration

### Account-Level Defaults
Set organization-wide alerting defaults that apply to all checks unless overridden:

```yaml
# Account-level alert settings
Escalation Strategy: Run-based (2 consecutive failures)
Reminder Schedule: 
  - First reminder: 5 minutes
  - Second reminder: 15 minutes
Alert Channels:
  - Email: team@company.com
  - Slack: #ops-alerts
Location Threshold: 50% of locations must fail
```

### Group-Level Overrides
Configure specific alerting behavior for related checks:

```yaml
# Production API Group
Escalation Strategy: Time-based (5 minutes)
Alert Channels:
  - PagerDuty: Production escalation policy
  - Slack: #production-alerts
Mute Alerts: During maintenance windows

# Development Group
Escalation Strategy: Run-based (3 consecutive failures)
Alert Channels:
  - Email: dev-team@company.com
Reminder Schedule: None
```

### Check-Level Customization
Fine-tune alerting for individual checks with specific requirements:

```yaml
# Critical payment API
Escalation Strategy: Immediate (first failure)
Alert Channels:
  - PagerDuty: Payment team escalation
  - SMS: On-call engineer
Retry Strategy: Fixed (3 retries, 10 second intervals)

# Internal monitoring dashboard
Escalation Strategy: Run-based (5 consecutive failures)
Alert Channels:
  - Email: Internal team
Mute Alerts: Enabled during development
```

## Advanced Retry Strategies

### Fixed Interval Retries
Consistent timing between retry attempts:

```typescript
// Good for: Consistent network issues, simple service hiccups
const fixedRetry = {
  strategy: "fixed",
  interval: 10, // 10s, 10s, 10s
  maxRetries: 3,
  maxDuration: 60
}
```

### Linear Backoff Retries
Gradually increasing intervals:

```typescript
// Good for: Services that need time to recover
const linearRetry = {
  strategy: "linear",
  baseInterval: 5, // 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s
  maxRetries: 4,
  maxDuration: 120
}
```

### Exponential Backoff Retries
Rapidly increasing intervals:

```typescript
// Good for: Rate-limited APIs, overloaded services
const exponentialRetry = {
  strategy: "exponential",
  baseInterval: 5, // 5s, 25s, 125s (2m 5s)
  maxRetries: 3,
  maxDuration: 180
}
```

### Network-Specific Retries
Automatic retries for network-related failures:

```typescript
// Retry only on network errors, not application errors
const networkRetry = {
  enabled: true,
  retryOnNetworkErrors: [
    "ECONNRESET",
    "ENOTFOUND", 
    "ETIMEDOUT",
    "EAI_AGAIN",
    "ECONNREFUSED"
  ],
  skipOnHttpStatus: true // Don't retry 4xx/5xx responses
}
```

## Smart Location-Based Alerting

### Location Failure Thresholds
Reduce noise from regional outages:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Global service monitoring" icon="globe">
```yaml
Locations: 6 worldwide
Threshold: 50% must fail
Result: Alert only when 3+ locations fail
Use case: CDN or global service availability
```
</Card>

<Card title="Regional service monitoring" icon="map">
```yaml
Locations: 3 regional
Threshold: 67% must fail  
Result: Alert when 2+ locations fail
Use case: Regional service or data center
```
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Location-Based Retry Logic

```typescript
// Retry from same location (location-specific issues)
const sameLocationRetry = {
  sameLocation: true,
  useCase: "Network routing issues, regional problems"
}

// Retry from different location (service availability)
const differentLocationRetry = {
  sameLocation: false, 
  useCase: "General service uptime, global availability"
}
```

## Webhook Integration and Custom Alerts

### Advanced Webhook Configuration
Create sophisticated integrations with third-party systems:

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.incident-system.com/webhooks/{{WEBHOOK_TOKEN}}",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{API_TOKEN}}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-Checkly-Source": "monitoring"
  },
  "body": {
    "incident": {
      "title": "{{ALERT_TITLE}}",
      "severity": "{{#eq ALERT_TYPE 'ALERT_FAILURE'}}high{{else}}medium{{/eq}}",
      "description": "Check {{CHECK_NAME}} failed at {{STARTED_AT}} from {{RUN_LOCATION}}",
      "metadata": {
        "check_id": "{{CHECK_ID}}",
        "response_time": "{{RESPONSE_TIME}}",
        "result_link": "{{RESULT_LINK}}",
        "location": "{{RUN_LOCATION}}",
        "tags": [{{#each TAGS}}"{{this}}"{{#unless @last}},{{/unless}}{{/each}}]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Webhook Security and Validation
Ensure webhook authenticity with cryptographic signatures:

```javascript
// Verify webhook signature (Node.js example)
const crypto = require('crypto')

function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secret)
  const digest = hmac.update(payload).digest('hex')
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(digest), 
    Buffer.from(signature)
  )
}

// Express.js webhook handler
app.post('/checkly-webhook', (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers['x-checkly-signature']
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body)
  
  if (verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET)) {
    // Process validated webhook
    handleAlert(req.body)
    res.status(200).send('OK')
  } else {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized')
  }
})
```

## SSL Certificate Monitoring

### Automatic SSL Alerting
Monitor certificate expiration across your infrastructure:

```yaml
SSL Alert Configuration:
  Warning Threshold: 30 days before expiration
  Critical Threshold: 7 days before expiration
  Check Frequency: Daily
  Alert Channels:
    - Email: security-team@company.com
    - Slack: #security-alerts
  
SSL Variables Available:
  - SSL_DAYS_REMAINING: Days until expiration
  - SSL_CHECK_DOMAIN: Certificate domain
  - ALERT_TITLE: "SSL certificate for {domain} expires in {days} days"
```

### SSL Webhook Example
Create custom SSL certificate monitoring workflows:

```json
{
  "alert_type": "ssl_expiration",
  "domain": "{{SSL_CHECK_DOMAIN}}",
  "days_remaining": {{SSL_DAYS_REMAINING}},
  "expires_at": "{{STARTED_AT}}",
  "priority": "{{#lt SSL_DAYS_REMAINING 7}}critical{{else}}warning{{/lt}}",
  "action_required": {{#lt SSL_DAYS_REMAINING 14}}true{{else}}false{{/lt}},
  "certificate_info": {
    "check_id": "{{CHECK_ID}}",
    "result_link": "{{RESULT_LINK}}"
  }
}
```

## Alert Optimization and Best Practices

### Frequency-Based Configuration
Tailor alerting strategies to your check frequency:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
<Card title="High frequency (1-5 min)" icon="zap">
```yaml
Strategy: Time-based (10 minutes)
Retries: 2 with linear backoff
Location threshold: 67%
Use case: Critical services
```
</Card>

<Card title="Standard frequency (10-30 min)" icon="clock">
```yaml
Strategy: Run-based (2 failures)
Retries: 3 with exponential backoff
Location threshold: 50%
Use case: Most applications
```
</Card>

<Card title="Low frequency (1+ hours)" icon="timer">
```yaml
Strategy: Run-based (1 failure)
Retries: 5 with exponential backoff
Location threshold: 33%
Use case: Background jobs
```
</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Environment-Specific Alerting
Configure different alerting behavior across environments:

```yaml
Production:
  Escalation: Immediate for critical checks
  Channels: PagerDuty + Slack + SMS
  Retries: Minimal (reduce MTTR)
  
Staging:
  Escalation: After 2 failures
  Channels: Slack + Email
  Retries: Moderate (balance noise vs detection)
  
Development:
  Escalation: After 5 failures
  Channels: Email only
  Retries: Aggressive (reduce false positives)
```
