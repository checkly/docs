</Tip>
Monitor your scheduled jobs, background tasks, and automated processes with Checkly's heartbeat monitoring. Unlike traditional active monitoring, heartbeat monitors work passively—they listen for regular "pings" from your tasks to ensure they're running as expected.


## What are Heartbeat Monitors?

Heartbeat monitors are passive monitoring checks that wait for your automated tasks to report their successful completion. When your scheduled job, backup script, or cron job finishes successfully, it sends a simple HTTP request (a "ping") to Checkly to confirm it ran.

If Checkly doesn't receive a ping within the expected timeframe, it triggers alerts to notify you that something may have gone wrong.

Heartbeat monitors are perfect for: 
- Backup jobs and data exports
- ETL processes and data imports  
- Scheduled maintenance scripts
- Newsletter and email campaigns
- Database cleanup tasks
- File processing workflows

## How Heartbeat Monitoring Works

The heartbeat monitoring process is straightforward. Once created, your heartbeat monitor provides a unique ping URL. Your tasks should make an HTTP GET or POST request to this URL when they complete successfully.

1. **Create a monitor** - Set up a heartbeat monitor with your expected ping frequency
2. **Get your ping URL** - Checkly provides a unique URL for your task to ping
3. **Add the ping** - Include a simple HTTP request in your task's success path
4. **Monitor results** - Checkly tracks pings and alerts you when they're 

<Tip>
Always add the heartbeat ping at the very end of your task, after all critical operations have completed successfully. This ensures you only get "success" pings when your job actually finished.

## Construct

### Heartbeat Example

Here's how you'd monitor a backup script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# backup.sh

# Run your backup process
pg_dump mydb > backup.sql
aws s3 cp backup.sql s3://my-backup-bucket/

# Only ping if backup succeeded
curl -m 5 --retry 3 https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-heartbeat-id
```

### Request Configuration

When creating heartbeat monitors, you can configure timing parameters to match your task's schedule:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Range | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------|-------------|
| `period` | `number` | ✅ | 30 seconds - 365 days | The expected period of time between each ping |
| `periodUnit` | `string` | ✅ | `'seconds'` \| `'minutes'` \| `'hours'` \| `'days'` | The unit of time for the period |
| `grace` | `number` | ✅ | 0 seconds - 365 days | The grace period to wait for before sending an alert |
| `graceUnit` | `string` | ✅ | `'seconds'` \| `'minutes'` \| `'hours'` \| `'days'` | The unit of time for the grace period |

<Warning>
The grace period starts counting after the expected period expires. For example, with a 1-hour period and 5-minute grace, alerts trigger if no ping is received within 65 minutes of the last ping. Set grace periods carefully. Too short and you’ll get false alarms from normal execution variance. Too long and you’ll miss actual failures.
</Warning>


### Example Configurations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Daily Backup">
    ```ts
    // Daily backup job with 30 minute grace period
    period: 1,
    periodUnit: 'days',
    grace: 30,
    graceUnit: 'minutes'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Hourly Task">
    ```ts
    // Hourly process with 10 minute grace period
    period: 1,
    periodUnit: 'hours',
    grace: 10,
    graceUnit: 'minutes'
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Weekly Report">
    ```ts
    // Weekly report with 2 hour grace period
    period: 7,
    periodUnit: 'days',
    grace: 2,
    graceUnit: 'hours'
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Locations
Since heartbeat monitors start from your own infrastructure, there is no need to configure locations.








## Metrics

Heartbeat monitors provide different metrics andinsights than other types of checks and monitors:

- **Ping History**: Timeline of when pings were received
- **Missed Pings**: Gaps where expected pings didn't arrive
- **Alert Timeline**: When alerts were triggered and resolved
- **Source Tracking**: Which systems or processes sent pings

Use this data to:
- Identify patterns in job failures
- Optimize grace periods based on actual variance
- Track the reliability of different scheduled processes
- Coordinate incident response when jobs fail

<Warning>
Remember: Heartbeat monitors detect when jobs fail to complete, but they can't tell you why a job failed. Combine heartbeat monitoring with application logging and error tracking for complete observability.
</Warning>


## Best Practices

**Always include timeout and retry options:**
```bash
# Good: With timeout and retries
curl -m 5 --retry 3 https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id

# Bad: No timeout or retry protection
curl https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id
```

**Position pings correctly in your code:**
```python
# Good: Ping only after success
try:
    run_backup()
    upload_to_s3()
    # Only ping if everything succeeded
    requests.get(ping_url, timeout=5)
except Exception as e:
    # Don't ping on failure - let heartbeat alert
    log_error(e)
```

**Use source headers for tracking:**
```bash
curl -H "Origin: backup-server-01" https://ping.checklyhq.com/your-id
```


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Monitor Not Starting">
- **Issue**: Timer doesn't start after first ping
- **Solution**: Check that the monitor is activated and the ping URL is correct

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="False Alerts">
- **Issue**: Getting alerts even when job runs successfully
- **Solution**: Increase grace period or check if ping is being sent correctly

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Missing Pings">
- **Issue**: Job runs but no ping is received
- **Solution**: Verify network connectivity and ping URL accessibility

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Timer Reset Issues">
- **Issue**: Timer doesn't reset after successful ping
- **Solution**: Check ping method (GET/POST) and ensure no network timeouts
