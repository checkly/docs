## What is AI Error Analysis?

Checkly has an AI error analysis feature that is able to:
- Analyzes your monitoring data to identify pattewrns and anomalies
- Provides intelligent recommendations for issue resolution
- Helps you understand complex system failures

## Key Capabilities
### Playwright Test Analysis

On each failed Browser or Playwright Check result, Checkly AI analyzes the traces, script code, screenshots and script code to provide you with a detailed analysis of the failure.
This includes:

- **End-user impact**: Checkly AI analyzes the failure and provides you with a list of impacted users and features. The text used is generated by AI and can be enriched with organisation-specific domain knowledge using the **Tag description editor** the [AI settings screen](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/ai).
- **Step summary**: Checkly AI summarizes the steps in the check script, making it easier to understand what the check is doing and where it failed.
- **Root cause**: Checkly AI analyzes the failure and provides you with a root cause analysis, helping you quickly remediate the issue.

### Tag Description Editor

Using the [Tag Description Editor](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/ai), you can add custom descriptions to your tags. Checkly AI uses these descriptions to
provide more context and insights into failures and the impact on user groups, features and applications.

This is very useful for organizations with specific domain knowledge and terminology embedded in their tags. For example,
a tag like `feat:checkout` can be enriched with a description like "This tag is used for the checkout feature of our e-commerce application, which allows users to purchase products online."

## Data Privacy and Security

All AI features are designed to operate on the data you provide or the data generated by your checks. This data is already
stored in Checkly, and we do not send any additional data to third-party AI providers.

Any provided [environment secrets](https://www.checklyhq.com/docs/api-checks/variables/) are scrubbed before being sent to the AI provider.

We do not train any custom models on your data. Any data used by the AI features is processed in real-time and not stored for future use.
To address further privacy concerns, you can bring your own AI model and provider to Checkly. For more information, see the section below on built-in and custom models.

## Built-in and Custom Models

By default, Checkly uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1 model for AI features. However, you can also bring your own model (BYOM) and provider to Checkly.
To do this, you need to set up a custom AI provider in the [AI settings screen](https://app.checklyhq.com/settings/account/ai).

<Info>
 The Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) feature is available for Enterprise customers only.
