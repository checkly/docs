We've optimized the [Checkly CLI](/cli/overview/) to work in any CI/CD workflow. Here are the basics you need to know that will come in handy when adapting the examples we give you to your own, specific setup.

1. For **authentication**, make sure to set the `CHECKLY_API_KEY` and `CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID` parameters as environment variables
in your CI/CD platform.
2. Set the **reporter** you want to use for the `test` command using the `--reporter` flag, i.e. `--reporter=dot`.
3. To store a **test session** with full logging, traces and vides, set the `--record` flag for the `test` command.
4. Use the `--force` flag on the `deploy` and / or `destroy` commands to skip the normal confirmation steps.

When using the `--record` flag, the CLI will attempt to parse `git` specific information from
the environment to display in the recorded test session as metadata. However, you can also set these data items specifically by using environment variables.

| item               | auto | variable                                               | description                                |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Repository**     | false        | `repoUrl` in `checkly.config.ts` or `CHECKLY_REPO_URL` | The URL of your repo on GitHub, GitLab etc. |
| **Commit hash**    | true         | `CHECKLY_REPO_SHA`                                     | The SHA of the commit.               |
| **Branch**         | true         | `CHECKLY_REPO_BRANCH`                                  | The branch name.                     |
| **Commit owner**   | true         | `CHECKLY_REPO_COMMIT_OWNER`                            | The committer's name or email.       |
| **Commit message** | true         | `CHECKLY_REPO_COMMIT_MESSAGE`                          | The commit message.                  |
| **Environment**    | false        | `CHECKLY_TEST_ENVIRONMENT`                             | The environment name, e.g. "staging" |


## A Basic pipeline example

Create a new Jenkinsfile in your repo, or add the steps and stages from the example below to your existing file.
This pipeline is "branch aware" and treats the `main` branch as the production branch. This means checks are only deployed
to Checkly after they are ran against production (after merging to `main`) and the checks passed.

## Configuring Jenkins to run the Checkly CLI

As the Checkly CLI is a Node.js project, the main step you need to take is install the NodeJS plugin.

1. In Jenkins, go to **Manage Jenkins → Plugins → Available plugins** and look for the NodeJS plugin and install it.
2. After installing the NodeJS plugin, we need to configure it. Head over to **Manage Jenkins → Tools** and click "Add NodeJS"

We recommend using any Node.js stable version higher than 16.x.

## Set your Checkly credentials

Navigate to **Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials** to add your Checkly account ID and API key to your preferred scope.
Store them as "secret text" and assign and ID to the credential.

## Configuring the Jenkins Pipeline

Add the `Jenkinsfile` to your repo that defines the basic stages and steps. Make sure to set up your SCM settings
correctly so Jenkins can fetch your git repo and look for the `Jenkinsfile` in the root of your project.

The actual contents of your `Jenkinsfile` will differ based on your code and how you deploy. But in general, your pipeline
should look as follows:

1. You deploy your application first.
2. You install the required dependencies for the Checkly CLI.
3. You run the `checkly test` command.

```groovy Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {nodejs "Node 18"}
    environment {
        CHECKLY_API_KEY = credentials('checkly-api-key')
        CHECKLY_ACCOUNT_ID = credentials('checkly-account-id')
        CHECKLY_TEST_ENVIRONMENT='production'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
        stage('Dependencies') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm ci'
            }
        }
        stage('checkly test') {
            steps {
                sh 'npx checkly test --record'
            }
        }
        stage('checkly deploy') {
            when {
                branch "main"
            }
            steps {
                sh 'npx checkly deploy --force'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
