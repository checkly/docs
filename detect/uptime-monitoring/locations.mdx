## Available Global Locations

### North America
- **US East** (N. Virginia)
- **US West** (Oregon)  
- **US Central** (Dallas)
- **Canada Central** (Toronto)

### Europe
- **EU West** (Ireland)
- **EU Central** (Frankfurt)
- **EU North** (Stockholm)
- **UK South** (London)

- **Asia Pacific Southeast** (Singapore)
- **Asia Pacific Northeast** (Tokyo)
- **Asia Pacific South** (Mumbai)
- **Asia Pacific East** (Sydney)

### Other Regions
- **South America** (SÃ£o Paulo)
- **Middle East** (Bahrain)
- **Africa** (Cape Town)

## Location Selection Strategies

### Match Your User Base
Select locations where your actual users are located to get realistic performance data and user experience insights.

**Global Services:**
```
Primary: US East, EU West, Asia Pacific Southeast
Secondary: US West, EU Central, Asia Pacific Northeast
```

**Regional Services:**
```
North America: US East, US West, Canada Central
Europe: EU West, EU Central, UK South
Asia Pacific: AP Southeast, AP Northeast, AP South
```

### Coverage vs. Cost Balance

<Card title="Essential Coverage" icon="target">
2-3 strategic locations covering your primary markets
</Card>

<Card title="Comprehensive Coverage" icon="network-wired">
5-7 locations providing global reach and redundancy
</Card>
</CardGroup>

**Recommended Starting Points:**
- **Startup/SMB**: 2-3 locations in primary regions
- **Growing Business**: 4-5 locations including international
- **Enterprise**: 6+ locations with private location supplements

## Private Locations

Private locations enable monitoring of internal services and compliance-restricted environments.

### Use Cases
- **Internal APIs** and microservices
- **Database servers** and infrastructure components  
- **Services behind firewalls** or VPNs
- **Compliance environments** with data sovereignty requirements
- **Development and staging** environments

### Setup Requirements
1. Deploy Checkly agent in your infrastructure
2. Configure network access and firewall rules
3. Register location in Checkly dashboard
4. Assign monitors to private location

<Note>
Private locations are available on Team and Enterprise plans. See [Private Locations documentation](/detect/private-locations/overview) for setup details.

## Location-Specific Considerations

### Network Performance Factors
- **Geographic distance** from your servers
- **Internet infrastructure quality** in each region
- **CDN and edge server** distribution
- **Network routing paths** and peering relationships

### Monitor Type Implications

**URL Monitors:**
- Test from locations matching your web traffic
- Consider CDN performance variations
- Account for regional DNS resolution differences

**TCP Monitors:**
- Focus on locations with direct network connectivity
- Consider firewall and security policies
- Test from regions accessing your infrastructure

**Heartbeat Monitors:**
- Location affects ping delivery reliability
- Consider network connectivity from job execution environments
- Private locations ideal for internal scheduled tasks

## Understanding Multi-Location Results

### Status Aggregation
- Monitor shows **DOWN** if failing from any location
- **Partial outages** indicate regional issues
- **Location-specific failures** help isolate problems

### Performance Analysis
Different response times across locations are normal and provide valuable insights:

```
Normal Patterns:
- Nearby locations: < 200ms
- Continental: 200-500ms  
- Intercontinental: 500ms+

Investigation Triggers:
- Single location consistently 2x slower
- Sudden performance degradation in specific region
- New locations showing unexpected patterns
```

## Best Practices

### Initial Setup
1. **Start with 2-3 strategic locations** in your primary markets
2. **Include one location near your infrastructure** for baseline performance
3. **Add international locations** based on user distribution
4. **Monitor and adjust** based on actual usage patterns

### Ongoing Optimization
- **Review location performance** monthly
- **Adjust based on business expansion** into new regions
- **Consider seasonal traffic patterns** and user behavior
- **Remove underutilized locations** to optimize costs

### Troubleshooting Location Issues

**Single Location Problems:**
```yaml
Symptoms: One location failing while others pass
Diagnosis: 
  - Check regional network issues
  - Verify CDN configuration
  - Test manual connectivity from region
Resolution: May require infrastructure or routing changes
```

**Multiple Location Problems:**
```yaml
Symptoms: Failures across multiple regions
Diagnosis:
  - Check overall service health
  - Review recent deployments
  - Verify DNS and CDN status
Resolution: Likely requires service-level fixes
```

## Scheduling Strategies by Location

### Parallel Execution
All locations test simultaneously for fastest issue detection:
- **Pros**: Immediate global status, fastest alerting
- **Cons**: Higher server load, increased monitoring costs
- **Best for**: Critical services requiring immediate detection

### Round-Robin Execution
Locations test in sequence to distribute load:
- **Pros**: Reduced server impact, lower costs
- **Cons**: Slower detection, sequential failure discovery
- **Best for**: Non-critical services, high-frequency monitoring

## Advanced Location Configuration

### Region-Based Alerting
Configure different alert behaviors by location:

```yaml
Critical Regions (US East, EU West):
  - Immediate alerts on any failure
  - SMS escalation after 5 minutes

Secondary Regions (Other locations):
  - Email alerts after 2 consecutive failures
  - Slack notification after 10 minutes
```

### Location-Specific Thresholds
Adjust expectations based on regional characteristics:

```yaml
US East (Primary datacenter): 
  - Response time threshold: 500ms
  - Immediate alerting

Asia Pacific (Distant region):
  - Response time threshold: 1500ms  
  - Allow for higher latency
```
