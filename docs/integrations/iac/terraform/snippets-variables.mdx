Checkly provides resources to eliminate code duplication and reduce maintenance overhead in your monitoring setup.

## Code snippets

[Code snippets](/docs/browser-checks/partials-code-snippets/) allow you to reuse code across multiple checks without duplication. They work with [setup & teardown scripts](/docs/api-checks/setup-teardown-scripts/#reusable-code-snippets) in API checks and [browser checks](/docs/browser-checks/partials-code-snippets/).

<Accordion title="Inline snippet definition">
```terraform
resource "checkly_snippet" "login-procedure" {
  name   = "Login"
  script = <<EOT
    await page.fill('#email', process.env.TEST_EMAIL)
    await page.fill('#password', process.env.TEST_PASSWORD)
    await page.click('#login-button')
EOT
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="File-based snippet definition (recommended)">
```terraform
resource "checkly_snippet" "login-procedure" {
  name   = "Login"
  script = file("${path.module}/snippets/login.js")
}
```

Store your snippet in a separate file for better organization and syntax highlighting.
</Accordion>

## Environment variables

[Environment variables](/docs/browser-checks/variables/) store sensitive data like credentials or configuration values that can be used across checks and groups.

<Accordion title="Check-level variables">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check" "user-login" {
  name      = "User Login Flow"
  type      = "BROWSER"
  activated = true
  frequency = 5
  
  environment_variables = {
    TEST_EMAIL    = "user@example.com"
    TEST_PASSWORD = "secure-password"
    API_BASE_URL  = "https://api.example.com"
  }
  
  locations = ["us-west-1", "eu-central-1"]
  script    = file("${path.module}/scripts/login.spec.js")
}
```

Variables defined at check level are only available to that specific check.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Group-level variables">
```terraform
resource "checkly_check_group" "ecommerce-flows" {
  name      = "E-commerce Flows"
  activated = true
  
  environment_variables = {
    TEST_EMAIL    = "user@example.com"
    TEST_PASSWORD = "secure-password"
    API_BASE_URL  = "https://api.example.com"
  }
  
  locations   = ["us-west-1", "eu-central-1"]
  concurrency = 3
}
```

Variables defined at group level are inherited by all checks within that group.
</Accordion>

<Note>
Account-level environment variables via Terraform are coming soon. For now, use check or group-level variables for your monitoring setup.
