## What are Playwright Checks?

Playwright Checks enable you to run entire Playwright Suites or Projects as both pre-production tests and global production monitors, without rewriting your tests and configuration.

Unlike [Browser Checks](detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview), Playwright Checks are not limited to a single test spec running in an async browser session and our preinstalled runtime dependencies. Playwright Checks enable you to run Playwright projects complete with all of your required dependencies, private packages, storage, data, and more. It's a complete native way to run Playwright in production, enabling you to detect issues with your applications or services even in the most complex scenarios.

Playwright Checks support for the full Playwright API and ecosystem, meaning you can use your existing tests and `playwright.config.ts` files as is.

<Note>
Playwright Checks are currently in Beta. Join the [Slack community](https://checklycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-2qc51mpyr-5idwVD4R4izkf5FC4CFk1A#/shared-invite/email) to get live updates on feature development and get help getting started.
</Note>

**Playwright Checks are perfect for:**
- Converting existing E2E tests into monitoring
- Testing complex user workflows across multiple browsers
- Monitoring critical business processes
- Validating application functionality after deployments


## How Playwright Checks Work

<Steps>
<Step title="1. Test Discovery">
Playwright Checks analyze your Playwright configuration and test files to understand your existing test structure.
</Step>

<Step title="2. Selective Monitoring">
Use tags and projects to define monitoring scope, choosing which tests become production monitors.
</Step>

<Step title="3. Global Deployment">
Deploy your selected tests to run from multiple worldwide locations for comprehensive coverage.
</Step>

<Step title="4. Continuous Monitoring">
Execute tests on schedules with performance tracking and detailed reporting.
</Step>

<Step title="5. Alert Integration">
Receive notifications when tests fail or performance degrades, keeping your team informed.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Runtime Limits**: During Beta, Playwright Checks can run up to 20 minutes per execution. This limit can be adjusted based on feedback.
</Info>

## Test Selection

Control which tests become monitoring checks using:

- **Tags**: Select tests marked with specific tags (e.g., `@critical`, `@smoke`)
- **Projects**: Choose browser configurations from your Playwright config
- **Combinations**: Mix tags and projects for precise test selection

```typescript
// Example: Monitor critical tests in Chromium
{
  name: 'Critical User Flows',
  pwTags: '@critical',
  pwProjects: 'chromium',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_1M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1']
}
```

## Monitoring Configuration

Customize monitoring behavior with:

- **Frequency**: From every minute to custom schedules
- **Locations**: Choose from global monitoring regions
- **Alerting**: Configure team notifications and escalation
- **Groups**: Organize related checks for management
- **Dependencies**: Support for private packages and custom registries
