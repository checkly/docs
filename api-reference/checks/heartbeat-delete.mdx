## Overview

The Delete Heartbeat Check endpoint permanently removes a heartbeat monitoring check from your account. This action cannot be undone and will stop all process monitoring for the deleted check.

<Warning>
Deleting heartbeat checks is permanent and cannot be undone. All historical ping data and process monitoring history will be permanently removed.
