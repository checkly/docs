The `checkly pw-test` command runs Playwright tests with Checkly monitoring features and reuses the Playwright CLI arguments.
This command automatically records test sessions without requiring the `--record` flag.

<Accordion title="Prerequisites">
Before using `checkly pw-test`, ensure you have:

- An initialized Checkly CLI project
- Valid Checkly account authentication (run `npx checkly login` if needed)
- Playwright tests in your project
- A `playwright.config.ts` or `playwright.config.js` file.

</Accordion>

## Basic Usage

Use `--` to separate Checkly flags from Playwright test options.

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test [checkly options] -- [playwright options]
```

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Checkly Command Options">

Define `checkly pw-test` specific options before the `--` separator:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--config` | The Checkly CLI configuration file. If not passed, uses the `checkly.config.ts\|js` file in the current directory. |
| `--create-check` | Create a Checkly check from the Playwright test. |
| `--env, -e` | Env vars to be passed to the test run. Default: [] |
| `--env-file` | dotenv file path to be passed. For example `--env-file="./.env"` |
| `--location, -l` | The location to run the checks at. |
| `--private-location` | The private location to run checks at. |
| `--[no-]record` | Record test results in Checkly as a test session with full logs, traces and videos. |
| `--reporter` | A list of custom reporters for the test output. |
| `--stream-logs` | Stream logs from the test run to the console. |
| `--test-session-name` | A name to use when storing results in Checkly |
| `--timeout` | A timeout (in seconds) to wait for checks to complete. |
| `--verbose` | Always show the full logs of the checks. |

</Tab>
<Tab title="Playwright Test Options">

Define Playwright test runner flags after the `--` separator:

| Option | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--project` | Select Playwright projects |
| `--grep` | Filter tests by pattern |
| `--grep-invert` | Exclude tests by pattern |

<Tip>The `--reporter`, `--list`, and `--headed` options are not supported. Find more Playwright options in the [Playwright test runner docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli) .</Tip>

### Checkly Command Options

<ResponseField name="--config" type="string">

Specify a configuration file to use instead of the `checkly.config.ts` or `checkly.config.js` in the current directory.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test --config="./checkly.staging.config.ts"
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--create-check" type="boolean">

Add a new [Playwright Check Suite](/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) with your Playwright configuration to your `checkly.config`.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test --create-check
```

**Examples:**

Running this command:

```bash Terminal
 npx checkly pw-test --create-check -- --project="Mobile Chrome" --grep="@critical"
```

Adds a new Playwright Check Suite to your `checkly.config.ts`:

```typescript checkly.config.ts highlight={8-15}
const config = defineConfig({
  projectName: "Playwright Project",
  logicalId: "playwright-project",

  checks: {
    playwrightConfigPath: "./playwright.config.ts",
    playwrightChecks: [

        logicalId: "playwright-check-project-mobile-chrome-grep-critical",
        name: 'Playwright Test: "--project=Mobile Chrome" --grep=@critical',
        testCommand:
          'npx playwright test "--project=Mobile Chrome" --grep=@critical',
        locations: ["eu-central-1"],
        frequency: 10,
      },
    ],
  },
})
```

<Note>If there's no existing `checkly.config.ts` file, the `--create-check` option will create one.</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--env, -e">

Pass environment variables to the test run. Can be specified multiple times to set multiple variables.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test --env API_KEY=123 --env BASE_URL=https://example.com
npx checkly pw-test -e NODE_ENV=production -e DEBUG=true
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--env-file" type="string">

</ResponseField>

### Common Playwright Test Options

The `pw-test` command will reuse your `playwright.config` settings. To overwrite these values from the command line, [Playwright Check Suites](/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) supports most [Playwright test runner options](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-cli).

Here are some commonly used command line options for running your Playwright tests in the Checkly infrastructure.

<ResponseField name="--project" type="string">

Select specific Playwright projects to run. This allows you to run only a subset of your configured projects from your Playwright configuration.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test -- --project="chromium"
npx checkly pw-test -- --project="firefox"
```

<Note>You can only run projects specified in your `playwright.config` file.</Note>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--grep" type="string">

Filter tests to run based on a pattern match against test titles. Only tests matching the pattern will be executed.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep="@smoke"
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep="login|authentication"
```

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="--grep-invert" type="string">

Exclude tests from running based on a pattern match against test titles. Tests matching the pattern will be skipped.

**Usage:**

```bash Terminal
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep-invert="@slow"
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep-invert="flaky|unstable"
```

</ResponseField>

## Playwright Configuration vs. Applied Command Line Options

[Playwright Check Suites](/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/playwright-checks/overview) and the `pw-test` command read and parse your existing `playwright.config` to apply your configuration.

To differentiate between your local testing setup and the Checkly monitoring environment, you can rely on the set `CI` environment variable or override specific settings using command line options.

```ts playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    // ...
  ]
});
```

If you run `npx checkly pw-test` without additional arguments, the test suite will:

- run with `2` retries
- use `1` worker
- run all defined projects including `chromium`

All these options can be further customized by passing command line arguments to `pw-test`.

```bash Terminal
# Run with 4 workers, only in chromium, and 3 retries
npx checkly pw-test -- --workers=4 --project="chromium" --retries=3
```

## Examples

### Run tests in multiple browsers

```bash Terminal
# Using different Playwright projects
npx checkly pw-test -- --project=chromium --project=firefox
```

### Run tests by pattern

```bash Terminal
# Filter tests by grep pattern
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep="login"

# Exclude tests by pattern
npx checkly pw-test -- --grep-invert="skip|todo"
```

### Run tests by file

```bash Terminal
# Run a specific test file
npx checkly pw-test -- test.spec.ts
```

## Key Features

- `pw-test` automatically records test sessions (no `--record` flag needed)
- Your Playwright configuration applies automatically (traces, videos, screenshots)
- View all artifacts in Checkly's UI
