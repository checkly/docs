## Overview

IaC is a common way to configure heartbeat monitors. They are a simple way to ensure that your heartbeat monitors are running at a specific time.

## With Infrastructure as Code

Many teams manage heartbeat monitors alongside their infrastructure using tools like Terraform, ensuring monitoring is created when new scheduled jobs are deployed.

### Terraform Example

```hcl
resource "checkly_heartbeat" "daily_backup" {
  name        = "Daily Database Backup"
  period      = 24
  period_unit = "hours"
  grace       = 30
  grace_unit  = "minutes"
  tags        = ["backup", "database", "daily"]
  
  alert_channels = [
    checkly_alert_channel.email.id,
    checkly_alert_channel.slack.id
  ]
}

resource "checkly_heartbeat" "weekly_reports" {
  name        = "Weekly Analytics Reports"
  period      = 168  # 7 days in hours
  period_unit = "hours"
  grace       = 240  # 4 hours in minutes
  grace_unit  = "minutes"
  tags        = ["reports", "analytics", "weekly"]
}
```

### AWS CloudFormation Example

```yaml
Resources:
  HeartbeatMonitor:
    Type: AWS::CloudFormation::CustomResource
    Properties:
      ServiceToken: !GetAtt HeartbeatFunction.Arn
      Name: "Daily Backup Monitor"
      Period: 24
      PeriodUnit: "hours"
      Grace: 30
      GraceUnit: "minutes"
      Tags: ["backup", "daily"]
```
