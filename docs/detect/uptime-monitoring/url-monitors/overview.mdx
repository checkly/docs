<Tip>
**Monitoring as Code**: Learn more about the [URL Monitor Construct](/constructs/url-monitor).
</Tip>

Use URL monitors to track the availability of your HTTP-based services. They send HTTP requests to specified URLs and check for successful responses and acceptable response times.

**Typical use cases include:**

* Ensuring your marketing site returns a 200 OK
* Verifying your documentation site loads quickly
* Checking that your SSL certificate is still valid
* Confirming that a public pricing endpoint is reachable for customers


## Alerting

You can configure alerts to be triggered when a a URL goes down, returns an unexpected status code, or responds too slowly.

URL monitors can notify you via all available alerting channels for your plan. 

See more here: [Alerting](/docs/introduction/concepts/alerting).

## Locations

You can configure URL monitors to run from multiple locations around the world. This helps you ensure your application is available from all parts of the world.

See more here: [Locations](/docs/introduction/concepts/locations).

## Scheduling & Frequency

You can configure the frequency of your URL monitors to run at a frequency that is appropriate for the service being monitored. Unlike Synthetic Monitors, URL Monitors do not consume "Checks" and can be run on any frequency available to your plan.
