## What are API Checks?

API checks are automated HTTP requests that validate API endpoint functionality by checking status codes, response content, headers, and performance metrics. They simulate real API usage patterns and help catch issues before they impact your users.

**API checks are perfect for:**
- REST API endpoint monitoring
- GraphQL API validation
- Authentication system testing
- Third-party API dependency monitoring
- Microservice health checking
- Payment and transaction APIs

- HTTP method support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Request/response validation
- JSON schema validation
- Authentication handling
- Performance measurement
- Global monitoring locations

## How API Checks Work

API checks perform comprehensive endpoint validation:

1. **HTTP Request** - Sends configured requests with headers, body, and authentication
2. **Response Analysis** - Captures status codes, headers, body content, and timing
3. **Validation** - Runs assertions against response data and performance metrics
4. **Performance Tracking** - Measures response times and identifies trends
5. **Alert Generation** - Notifies teams when endpoints fail or degrade

<Tip>
API checks are ideal for testing both internal microservices and external API dependencies your application relies on.

## Metrics

### Response Time Thresholds
Set performance expectations:
- **Degraded Threshold**: Warning level (e.g., >1000ms)
- **Failed Threshold**: Critical level (e.g., >5000ms)

### Performance Metrics
Track comprehensive timing data:
- **DNS Resolution Time**: Domain name lookup duration
- **Connection Time**: TCP connection establishment
- **SSL Handshake Time**: Certificate negotiation (HTTPS only)
- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Server processing time
- **Content Download Time**: Response body transfer
- **Total Response Time**: Complete request cycle


## Locations
Monitor from multiple global locations:
- **North America**: US East, US West, Canada Central
- **Europe**: Ireland, Frankfurt, London, Stockholm
- **Asia Pacific**: Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Mumbai
- **Private Locations**: Your own infrastructure

### Regional Performance Analysis
- Compare response times across regions
- Identify geographic performance issues
- Validate CDN and edge server performance
- Test global API gateway configurations


## Alerts
Set up comprehensive alerting:
- **Immediate Alerts**: Critical endpoint failures
- **Escalation**: Multi-level notification chains
- **Recovery Notifications**: Automatic resolution alerts
- **Performance Alerts**: Degraded response time warnings
