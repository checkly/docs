## Managing Alert Channels

### Channel Configuration Overview

Configure channels with flexible subscription and filtering options:

![Alert channels management interface](/images/docs/images/alerting/alert-channels.png)

<Steps>
<Step title="Create Alert Channel">
Choose your notification method and provide connection details
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Alert Types">
Select which types of events should trigger notifications
</Step>

<Step title="Subscribe Checks">
Choose which checks and check groups use this channel
</Step>

<Step title="Test Integration">
Verify the channel works correctly with test notifications
</Step>
</Steps>

### Alert Type Selection

Choose which events trigger notifications for each channel:

| Alert Type | Description | Recommended For |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Failure** | Hard errors and assertion failures | All critical channels |
| **Degradation** | Performance threshold violations | Performance-focused teams |
| **Recovery** | Service restoration notifications | Operations and on-call teams |
| **SSL Expiration** | Certificate expiration warnings | Security and infrastructure teams |

### Check Subscription Management

Control which checks send alerts to each channel:

```yaml
# Example channel subscription strategy
Critical Production Channel:
  Subscribed Checks: Payment API, User Auth, Core Database
  Alert Types: Failure, Recovery
  
Performance Monitoring Channel:
  Subscribed Checks: All API checks
  Alert Types: Degradation, Recovery
  
Security Alerts Channel:
  Subscribed Checks: All SSL-enabled checks
  Alert Types: SSL Expiration
```

## Channel Management Best Practices

### Channel Organization Strategy

Structure your alert channels for effective incident response:

```yaml
# Recommended channel organization
Tier 1 - Critical Alerts:
  Channels: PagerDuty + SMS + Slack #critical
  Triggers: P1 checks, immediate escalation
  Recipients: On-call engineers, team leads
  
Tier 2 - Standard Alerts:  
  Channels: Slack #alerts + Email
  Triggers: Standard production checks
  Recipients: Engineering team, operations
  
Tier 3 - Development Alerts:
  Channels: Email + Slack #dev-alerts
  Triggers: Non-production environments
  Recipients: Development team only
  
Security Alerts:
  Channels: Email + Slack #security
  Triggers: SSL expiration, security checks
  Recipients: Security team, infrastructure team
```

### Alert Routing Logic

Implement intelligent alert routing based on check properties:

```yaml
Routing Rules:
  By Environment:
    - production/* → Critical channels
    - staging/* → Standard channels  
    - development/* → Development channels
    
  By Service:
    - payment* → Payment team + Critical
    - user-auth* → Security team + Critical
    - reporting* → Analytics team + Standard
    
  By Tags:
    - "critical" → PagerDuty + SMS
    - "performance" → Performance team
    - "security" → Security team
    
  By Time:
    - Business hours → Email + Slack
    - After hours → PagerDuty + SMS (critical only)
```

### Testing and Validation

<Steps>
<Step title="Monthly Channel Tests">
Send test alerts to verify all channels are working
</Step>

<Step title="Escalation Path Validation">
Test the complete escalation chain for critical alerts
</Step>

<Step title="Response Time Measurement">
Measure how quickly team members respond to alerts
</Step>

<Step title="Channel Performance Review">
Analyze alert delivery success rates and failure patterns
</Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

For teams new to alerting, we recommend starting with:

1. **Email notifications** for the entire team
2. **Slack integration** for real-time team communication
3. **PagerDuty** for critical production services with on-call coverage

As your monitoring program matures, add specialized channels like webhooks for custom integrations and SMS/phone calls for emergency escalation.

<Note>
Start with simple email and Slack alerts, then gradually add sophisticated integrations as your monitoring program matures.
</Note>

<Warning>
Always test your alert channels before depending on them for critical production monitoring. Failed alert delivery can be worse than no alerts at all.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Use Checkly's alert notification log to track delivery success rates and identify any channels that frequently fail to deliver notifications.
