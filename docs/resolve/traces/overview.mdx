Distributed tracing helps you understand how requests flow through your application and identify performance bottlenecks and failures. Checkly's tracing capabilities provide deep insights into your application's behavior.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing tracks requests as they flow through your application's services and infrastructure. It helps you:

- Understand request flow across services
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Debug failures and errors
- Optimize application performance

With telemetry traces configured, you will have access to traces in all the places where it matters to more quickly resolve issues:

- **Check results:** resolve production outages faster by correlating failing checks with infrastructure traces.
- **Test sessions:** understand any failures during test session execution.
- **Check editors:** get a live trace while building, editing and debugging check code.

## Trace Components
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Spans">
Individual units of work within a trace:
- **Root Span**: The initial request that starts the trace
- **Child Spans**: Subsequent operations within the request
- **Span Attributes**: Metadata about the operation
- **Span Events**: Important events during execution
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Trace Context">
Information that links spans together:
- **Trace ID**: Unique identifier for the entire trace
- **Span ID**: Unique identifier for each span
- **Parent Span ID**: Links child spans to their parent
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Trace Sampling">
Control which traces are collected:
- **Always On**: Collect all traces
- **Probabilistic**: Sample a percentage of traces
- **Adaptive**: Adjust sampling based on error rates
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Key Benefits

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Cost-Effective Tracing">
Only traces generated by Checkly checks are forwarded to third-party tools, significantly reducing data transfer costs while maintaining comprehensive monitoring coverage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Unified Observability">
Combine synthetic monitoring data with application traces in your existing observability platform for a complete picture of system health.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Faster Debugging">
When checks fail, trace data provides immediate context about what happened in your application stack, accelerating root cause analysis.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Seamless Integration">
Works with existing OpenTelemetry instrumentation and popular observability platforms without requiring changes to your application logic.
