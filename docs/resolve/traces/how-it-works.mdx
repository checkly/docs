Checkly Traces use OpenTelemetry to correlate synthetic check results with your application's backend traces. The diagram below shows how the dataflows connect to Checkly's monitoring and alerting pipeline.

## The Flow

<Steps>
<Step title="Automatic Instrumentation">
Checkly automatically adds `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers to all HTTP requests from your checks:

- **traceparent**: W3C compliant trace ID for each request
- **tracestate**: Set to `checkly=true` to identify Checkly as the trace origin

All check types (API, Browser, Multistep) include these headers. Browser and Multistep checks instrument multiple requests per check run.
</Step>

<Step title="Check Result Export">
Configure your 3rd party backend to receive check results as spans. Each span includes full check context:

```yaml
checkly.check.name: "ACME homepage"
checkly.check.id: "438481ea-0eab-43d6-8932-ab51bd0d49d6"
checkly.check.type: "browser"
checkly.check.location: "eu-west-1"
```

This correlates all backend spans with the check run that triggered them.
</Step>

<Step title="Direct Trace Ingestion">
**No 3rd party backend needed.** Send only Checkly-related traces directly to our endpoint:

- Endpoint: `otel.eu-west-1.checklyhq.com/v1/traces`
- Filter: Only traces marked `tracestate: checkly=true`
- Result: Traces appear in Checkly UI alongside check results

This keeps your OpenTelemetry setup lean while providing full trace correlation.
</Step>

<Step title="Alert Integration">
When checks fail, alerts include complete trace context:

- Full trace of the check run
- All backend spans included
- Quick root cause identification
- No need to jump between tools
</Step>
</Steps>


<Note>
Steps 3 and 4 provide the most value - complete trace visibility without requiring a 3rd party OpenTelemetry backend.
