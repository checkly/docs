npx checkly destroy --force --config ./checkly.staging.config.ts

# Destroy with verbose output
npx checkly destroy -f --verbose

## What Gets Destroyed

The destroy command removes the following resources that were created by your project:

- **Checks** (API, Browser, Heartbeat, etc.)
- **Check Groups** and their configurations
- **Alert Channels** defined in your project
- **Maintenance Windows** created via CLI
- **Environment Variables** at the project level
- **Private Locations** (if managed by the project)
- **Snippets** and reusable code blocks

<Warning>
**Shared Resources**: Be careful with shared resources like alert channels that might be used by other projects or manually created checks.
</Warning>

## Safety Considerations

### Confirmation Dialog
By default, the command prompts for confirmation:

```bash Terminal
⚠️  This will destroy all resources in your Checkly project.
Are you sure you want to continue? (y/N)
```

### Backup Recommendation
Before destroying, consider:
1. **Exporting configuration** to preserve setup
2. **Documenting dependencies** on shared resources
3. **Checking team coordination** to avoid conflicts

## Use Cases

### Clean Up Test Environment
Remove all test resources after development:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly destroy --config ./checkly.test.config.ts
```

### CI/CD Pipeline Cleanup
Automated cleanup in deployment pipelines:

```bash Terminal
npx checkly destroy --force --config ./checkly.preview.config.ts
```

### Project Migration
Remove old resources when migrating to new setup:

```bash Terminal
# Backup first, then destroy
npx checkly destroy --verbose
```
