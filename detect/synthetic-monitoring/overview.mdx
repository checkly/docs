## What is Synthetic Monitoring?

Synthetic monitoring goes beyond simple uptime checks by proactively validating your applications by simulating real user interactions and API workflows. Checkly's Synthetic Monitoring ensures your critical systems work correctly from both technical and user experience perspectives. It validates complete business processes, user experiences, and system integrations before your users encounter issues.


## Types of Synthetic Monitoring Checks

Checkly provides four powerful check types to comprehensively monitor your applications:

<Card title="API Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/api-checks/overview">
Monitor individual API endpoints with detailed request/response validation. 


</Card>


<Card title="Multistep Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/multistep-checks/overview">
Test complex API workflows with sequential requests and data flow validation.


</Card>
<Card title="Browser Checks" href="/docs/detect/synthetic-monitoring/browser-checks/overview">
Simulate real user interactions with automated browser testing using Playwright.
