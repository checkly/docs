## What are Browser Checks?

Browser checks are automated tests that use real browsers to interact with your web applications. They simulate user journeys like logging in, filling forms, making purchases, or navigating through complex workflows, ensuring your critical user paths work correctly.

**Browser checks are perfect for detecting downtime and performance issues in:**
- User authentication flows
- E-commerce checkout processes
- Form submissions and user journey validation
- Frontend performance monitoring

Supported Browsers:
- **Chromium**: Default browser, fast and reliable
- **Chrome**: Google Chrome for production-like testing
- **Mobile Simulation**: Test responsive designs and mobile workflows

## How Browser Checks Work


Checkly uses Playwright to power your Browser checks. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) is a robust, open-source framework for browser automation and end-to-end web application testing. It enables you to write idiomatic, reliable tests and easily control interactions within a web page. Browser checks execute automated test scripts in real browsers:

1. **Browser Launch** - Starts a real browser instance (Chromium or Chrome)
2. **Page Navigation** - Navigates to your web application
3. **User Interactions** - Simulates clicks, typing, form fills, and navigation
4. **Assertions** - Validates page content, elements, and user experience
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Captures Core Web Vitals and timing metrics
6. **Results Collection** - Records screenshots, videos, and detailed logs
7. **Alerts** - Triggers alerts if any of the assertions fail


## Check Structure

Create your Playwright test file in the Checkly IDE, then configure the check settings in the Checkly UI.

<Tab title="Structure in Code">
Browser checks use Playwright's test framework with a familiar structure. 

It works by connecting constructs to handle the configuration of your Browser Check, and then referencing the test file in your repository.

```ts browser-check.ts
import { BrowserCheck, Frequency } from 'checkly/constructs'
import * as path from 'path'

new BrowserCheck('browser-check-1', {
  name: 'Browser check #1',
  frequency: Frequency.EVERY_10M,
  locations: ['us-east-1', 'eu-west-1'],
  code: {
    entrypoint: path.join(__dirname, 'home.spec.js')
  }
})
```

```typescript home.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('User login workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // Navigate to login page
  await page.goto('https://app.example.com/login')
  
  // Fill in credentials
  await page.fill('[data-testid="email"]', 'user@example.com')
  await page.fill('[data-testid="password"]', 'securepassword')
  
  // Submit login form
  await page.click('[data-testid="login-button"]')
  
  // Verify successful login
  await expect(page.locator('[data-testid="dashboard"]')).toBeVisible()
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*dashboard/)
})
```
