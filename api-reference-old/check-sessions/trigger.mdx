## Overview

This endpoint triggers an ad-hoc check session for all **activated** checks matching the provided filters (equivalent to clicking *Schedule now* in the UI). If no filters are specified, all eligible checks are run.

The request returns immediately and does not wait for the session to finish. To track progress, use the 
* `GET /v1/check-sessions/{checkSessionId}/completion`
* `GET /v1/check-sessions/{checkSessionId}`

endpoints.

Standard alerting rules apply to finished check runs.
